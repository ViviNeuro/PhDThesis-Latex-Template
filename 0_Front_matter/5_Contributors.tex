The study design for \textbf{Chapter 2} was done jointly with Damiana Bergamo, Paola Cuoccio, Karen Konkoly, Kike Mun√µz Lombardo, Penny Lewis, and myself. Participants' recruitment and data collection were shared between Damiana Bergamo, Paola Cuoccio, Karen Konkoly, and myself. Ibad Kashif, Nial McGinley, Ralph Andrews, and Elena Schmidt also helped during data collection. Marit Petzka wrote the PVT script. I analysed the data, created the figures, and wrote the paper that Penny Lewis reviewed and edited. 

In \textbf{Chapter 3}, Miguel Navarrete helped create a Matlab script for the functional fixedness task. I collected the data with the help of Vanessa Hyde. I analysed the data and wrote the chapter, which was then reviewed and edited by Penny Lewis.

In \textbf{Chapter 4}, John Evans and Peter Hobden provided advice on the choice of MRI scans and parameters. The design of the protocol was done together with Sofia Pereira, and Tamas Foldes helped create the task scripts on Psychopy. Recruitment and data collection were shared between Sofia Pereira and me (including overnight cueing). Vanessa Hyde also helped with the last part of the behavioural data collection. Caterina Leitner and I sleep-scored the data using a custom-made interface written by Miguel Navarrete. Tamas Foldes and I analysed the data. I wrote the chapter, and Penny Lewis reviewed and edited it.
