At the end of this path, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to those who have played instrumental roles in my journey.

First and foremost, my deepest gratitude goes to \textbf{my supervisor, Penny Lewis.} From the very beginning, she believed in me and provided constant support. Her understanding, presence, and consistent encouragement have been invaluable. She has opened doors of possibilities and helped me realize my potential.

This thesis is dedicated to \textbf{my sister, Ilaria}. She is the person with whom I have shared the most challenging moments of my life and who has been my pillar of strength. Thank you for shaping the person I have become.

To my \textbf{parents}, with whom I will be forever indebted for the guidance needed to navigate through challenges and setbacks, and for the unwavering love.

To \textbf{my partner, James,} who has brought immeasurable joy and positivity into my life. Thank you for being by my side even when I was working all day. I am deeply grateful to you for continuously pushing me forward and believing in me. Sharing my life with you has been one of the best decisions I have ever made, and I cannot be happier.

I would also like to extend my thanks to all my \textbf{friends}. Some of them have been by my side since I was a 3-year-old, while others have entered my life during my numerous relocations. I am grateful for all the experiences and support we have shared. 

To my colleagues, thank you for the knowledge we have collectively gained and the countless sleepless nights we have spent together. I want to offer a special thanks to \textbf{Miguel}, \textbf{Sofia}, and \textbf{Tamas}. And a sincere acknowledgment to \textbf{Caterina}, who has been the perfect colleague and friend.

I am immensely grateful to all the participants who took part in my studies. Without your contributions, none of this would have been possible.
