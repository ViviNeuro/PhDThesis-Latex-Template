# PhDThesis-Latex-Template

Overview

This repository provides a LaTeX template for creating a doctoral thesis at Cardiff University. Please always check the current formatting guidelines of Cardiff University before submission.

The template is based on the \documentclass{book} LaTeX class. The primary file, Dissertation_main.tex, contains the necessary code and structure to start writing your thesis.

Included in this template is the "Introduction" section from my own thesis, serving as a practical example. The completed version of my thesis will be published at the end of March 2024 and will be available on the Orca Cardiff platform.
