              The role of {REM} (rapid eye movement) sleep for memory consolidation has been discussed for a long time. Boyce
              et al.
              used optogenetics to inhibit theta oscillations in the mouse hippocampus during {REM} sleep (see the Perspective by Kocsis). Both object recognition memory and contextual fear memory were impaired. This consolidation mechanism occurred in a critical time window immediately after training. Disrupting the same system for similar durations during non-{REM} sleep or wakefulness had no effect on memory.

              Rapid eye movement sleep ({REMS}) has been linked with spatial and emotional memory consolidation. However, establishing direct causality between neural activity during {REMS} and memory consolidation has proven difficult because of the transient nature of {REMS} and significant caveats associated with {REMS} deprivation techniques. In mice, we optogenetically silenced medial septum γ-aminobutyric acid–releasing ({MS}
              {GABA}
              ) neurons, allowing for temporally precise attenuation of the memory-associated theta rhythm during {REMS} without disturbing sleeping behavior. {REMS}-specific optogenetic silencing of {MS}
              {GABA}
              neurons selectively during a {REMS} critical window after learning erased subsequent novel object place recognition and impaired fear-conditioned contextual memory. Silencing {MS}
              {GABA}
              neurons for similar durations outside {REMS} episodes had no effect on memory. These results demonstrate that {MS}
              {GABA}
              neuronal activity specifically during {REMS} is required for normal memory consolidation.},

	abstract = {It is uncertain whether sleep preferentially consolidates emotional over neutral material. Some studies suggest that sleep enhances emotional memory (i.e., that there are large differences in strength of memory for valenced material compared to neutral material after a sleep-ﬁlled interval, but that this difference is smaller after a wake-ﬁlled interval). Others ﬁnd no such effect. We attempted to resolve this uncertainty by conducting a meta-analysis that compared valenced to neutral material after both sleep- and wake-ﬁlled delays. Standard search strategies identiﬁed 31 studies (containing 36 separate datasets) that met our inclusion criteria. Using random effects modeling, we conducted separate analyses for datasets comparing (a) negative vs. neutral material, (b) positive vs. neutral material, or (c) combined negative and positive vs. neutral material. We then speciﬁed several subgroup analyses to investigate potential moderators of the relationship between sleep and emotional memory consolidation. Results showed no overall effect for preferential sleep-dependent consolidation of emotional over neutral material. However, moderation analyses provided evidence for stronger effects when (a) studies used free recall rather than recognition outcome measures, or (b) delayed recall or recognition outcomes were controlled for initial learning. Those analyses also suggested that other methodological features (e.g., whether participants experience a full night of sleep and a regular daytime waking control condition rather than a nap and a night-time sleep deprivation control condition) and sample characteristics (e.g. all-male or not, young adult or not) should be carefully addressed in future research in this ﬁeld. These ﬁndings suggest that sleep does enhance emotional memory, but that in the laboratory the effect is only observed under particular methodological conditions. The conditions we identify as being critical to consider are consistent with general theories guiding scientiﬁc understanding of memory consolidation during sleep.},

In humans, these studies concentrated mainly on procedural types of memory, which are considered to be hippocampus-independent.

We show that declarative memory is enhanced when sleep follows within a few hours of learning, independent of time of day, and with equal amounts of interference during retention intervals. Sleep deprivation has a detrimental effect on memory, which was significant after a night of recovery sleep. Thus, fatigue accumulating during wake intervals could be ruled out as a confound.},

Design: The authors examined electroencephalograms of rats as they were subjected to 4-h daily sleep deprivation that continued for 7 consecutive days and assessed the spatial learning and memory by Morris water maze test ({WMT}). Participants: Adolescent and adult rats. Measurements and Results: Adolescent rats exhibited a similar amount of rapid eye movement ({REM}) and nonrapid eye movement ({NREM}) sleep with higher slow wave activity ({SWA}, 0.5-4 Hz) and fewer episodes and conversions with prolonged durations, indicating they have better sleep quality than adult rats. After {RSR}, adult rats showed strong rebound of {REM} sleep by 31\% on sleep deprivation day 1; this value was 37\% on sleep deprivation day 7 in adolescents compared with 20-h baseline level. On sleep deprivation day 7, {SWA} in adult and adolescent rats increased by 47\% and 33\%, and such elevation lasted for 5 h and 7 h, respectively. Furthermore, the authors investigated the effects of 4-h daily sleep deprivation immediately after the water maze training sessions on spatial cognitive performance. Adolescent rats sleep-restricted for 7 days traveled a longer distance to find the hidden platform during the acquisition training and had fewer numbers of platform crossings in the probe trial than those in the control group, something that did not occur in the sleep-deprived adult rats. Conclusion: Repeated sleep restriction ({RSR}) altered sleep profiles and mildly impaired spatial learning and memory capability in adolescent rats.},

	abstract = {Experience-dependent plasticity, the ability of the brain to constantly adapt to an ever-changing environment, has been suggested to be highest during childhood and to decline thereafter. However, empirical evidence for this is rather scarce. Slow-wave activity ({SWA}; {EEG} activity of 1–4.5 Hz) during deep sleep can be used as a marker of experience-dependent plasticity. For example, performing a visuomotor adaptation task in adults increased {SWA} during subsequent sleep over a locally restricted region of the right parietal cortex, which is known to be involved in visuomotor adaptation. Here, we investigated whether local experience-dependent changes in {SWA} vary as a function of brain maturation. Three age groups (children, adolescents, and adults) participated in a high-density {EEG} study with two conditions (baseline and adaptation) of a visuomotor learning task. Compared with the baseline condition, sleep {SWA} was increased after visuomotor adaptation in a cluster of eight electrodes over the right parietal cortex. The local boost in {SWA} was highest in children. Baseline {SWA} in the parietal cluster and right parietal gray matter volume, which both indicate region-specific maturation, were significantly correlated with the local increase in {SWA}. Our findings indicate that processes of brain maturation favor experience-dependent plasticity and determine how sensitive a specific brain region is for learning experiences. Moreover, our data confirm that {SWA} is a highly sensitive tool to map maturational differences in experience-dependent plasticity.},

Increasing evidence indicates that electrophysiological measures of sleep, especially slow wave activity ({SWA}), regulate the consolidation of motor and perceptual procedural memory. In contrast, the role of sleep {EEG} and {SWA} in modulating executive functions, including working memory ({WM}), has been far less characterized. Here, we investigated across-night changes in sleep {EEG} that may ameliorate {WM} performance. Participants (N ¼ 25, M ¼ 100\%) underwent two consecutive nights with high-density {EEG}, along with N-back tasks, which were administered at three time points the day before and after the second night of sleep. Non-rapid eye movement sleep {EEG} power spectra, power topography, as well as several slow-wave parameters were computed and compared across nights. Improvers on the 1-back, but not non-improvers, showed a signiﬁcant increase in {SWA} as well as in down slope and negative peak amplitude, in a fronto-parietal region, and these parameters increases predicted better {WM} performance. Overall, these ﬁndings show that slow-wave sleep has a beneﬁcial effect on {WM} and that it can occur in the adult brain even after minimal training. This is especially relevant, when considering that {WM} and other executive function cognitive deﬁcits are present in several neuropsychiatric disorders, and that slow-wave enhancing interventions can improve cognition, thus providing novel insights and treatment strategies for these patients.},

            Memory consolidation during sleep relies on the precisely timed interaction of rhythmic neural events. Here, we investigate differences in slow oscillations ({SO}; 0.5–1 Hz), sleep spindles ({SP}), and their coupling across the adult human lifespan and ask whether observed alterations relate to the ability to retain associative memories across sleep. We demonstrate that older adults do not show the fine-tuned coupling of fast {SPs} (12.5–16 Hz) to the {SO} peak present in younger adults but, instead, are characterized most by a slow {SP} power increase (9–12.5 Hz) at the end of the {SO} up-state. This slow {SP} power increase, typical for older adults, coincides with worse memory consolidation in young age already, whereas the tight precision of {SO}–fast {SP} coupling promotes memory consolidation across younger and older adults. Crucially, brain integrity in source regions of {SO} and {SP} generation, including the medial prefrontal cortex, thalamus, hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, reinforces this beneficial {SO}–{SP} coupling in old age. Our results reveal that cognitive functioning is not only determined by maintaining structural brain integrity across the adult lifespan, but also by the preservation of precisely timed neural interactions during sleep that enable the consolidation of declarative memories.},

            Sleep is thought to support memory consolidation via reactivation of prior experiences, with particular electrophysiological sleep signatures (slow oscillations ({SOs}) and sleep spindles) gating the information flow between relevant brain areas. However, empirical evidence for a role of endogenous memory reactivation (i.e., without experimentally delivered memory cues) for consolidation in humans is lacking. Here, we devised a paradigm in which participants acquired associative memories before taking a nap. Multivariate decoding was then used to capture endogenous memory reactivation during non-rapid eye movement ({NREM}) sleep in surface {EEG} recordings. Our results reveal reactivation of learning material during {SO}-spindle complexes, with the precision of {SO}-spindle coupling predicting reactivation strength. Critically, reactivation strength (i.e. classifier evidence in favor of the previously studied stimulus category) in turn predicts the level of consolidation across participants. These results elucidate the memory function of sleep in humans and emphasize the importance of {SOs} and spindles in clocking endogenous consolidation processes.},

            How are memories transferred from short-term to long-term storage? Systems-level memory consolidation is thought to be dependent on the coordinated interplay of cortical slow waves, thalamo-cortical sleep spindles and hippocampal ripple oscillations. However, it is currently unclear how the selective interaction of these cardinal sleep oscillations is organized to support information reactivation and transfer. Here, using human intracranial recordings, we demonstrate that the prefrontal cortex plays a key role in organizing the ripple-mediated information transfer during non-rapid eye movement ({NREM}) sleep. We reveal a temporally precise form of coupling between prefrontal slow-wave and spindle oscillations, which actively dictates the hippocampal-neocortical dialogue and information transfer. Our results suggest a model of the human sleeping brain in which rapid bidirectional interactions, triggered by the prefrontal cortex, mediate hippocampal activation to optimally time subsequent information transfer to the neocortex during {NREM} sleep.},

	abstract = {Human anterior and posterior hippocampus ({aHC}, {pHC}) differ in connectivity and behavioral correlates. Here we report physiological differences in humans of both sexes. During {NREM} sleep, the human hippocampus generates sharpwave ripples ({SWRs}) similar to those which in rodents mark memory replay. We show that while {pHC} generates {SWRs}, it also generates approximately as many spindle ripples ({SSR}: ripples phase-locked to local spindles). In contrast, {SSRs} are rare in {aHC}. Like {SWRs}, {SSRs} often co-occur with neocortical theta bursts ({TBs}), downstates ({DSs}), sleep spindles ({SSs}), and upstates ({USs}), which coordinate cortico-hippocampal interactions and facilitate consolidation in rodents. {SWRs} co-occur with these waves in widespread cortical areas, especially frontocentral. These waves typically occur in the sequence {TB}-{DS}-{SS}-{US}, with {SWRs} usually occurring before {SS}-{US}. In contrast, {SSRs} occur ∼350 ms later, with a strong preference for co-occurrence with posterior-parietal {SSs}. {pHC}-{SSs} were strongly phase-locked with parietal-{SSs}, and {pHC}-{SSRs} were phase-coupled with {pHC}-{SSs} and parietal-{SSs}. Human {SWRs} (and associated replay events, if any) are separated by ∼5 s on average, whereas ripples on successive {SSR} peaks are separated by only ∼80 ms. These distinctive physiological properties of {pHC}-{SSR} enable an alternative mechanism for hippocampal engagement with neocortex.
            
              {SIGNIFICANCE} {STATEMENT}
              Rodent hippocampal neurons replay waking events during sharpwave ripples ({SWRs}) in {NREM} sleep, facilitating memory transfer to a permanent cortical store. We show that human anterior hippocampus also produces {SWRs}, but spindle ripples predominate in posterior. Whereas {SWRs} typically occur as cortex emerges from inactivity, spindle ripples typically occur at peak cortical activity. Furthermore, posterior hippocampal spindle ripples are tightly coupled to posterior parietal locations activated by conscious recollection. Finally, multiple spindle ripples can recur within a second, whereas {SWRs} are separated by ∼5 s. The human posterior hippocampus is considered homologous to rodent dorsal hippocampus, which is thought to be specialized for consolidation of specific memory details. We speculate that these distinct physiological characteristics of posterior hippocampal spindle ripples may support a related function in humans.},

Whereas optogenetically stimulated spindles were as efﬁcient as spontaneous spindles in nesting hippocampal ripples within their excitable troughs, stimulation in-phase with the slow oscillation up-state increased spindle co-occurrence and frontal spindle-ripple co-occurrence, eventually resulting in increased triple coupling of slow oscillation-spindle-ripple events.

Can we delay age-related decline in cognitive function with interventions and stave off Alzheimer's disease? Does an aged brain really have the capacity to change in response to stimulation? In the present paper, we consider the neuroplasticity of the aging brain, that is, the brain's ability to increase capacity in response to sustained experience. We argue that, although there is some neural deterioration that occurs with age, the brain has the capacity to increase neural activity and develop neural scaffolding to regulate cognitive function. We suggest that increase in neural volume in response to cognitive training or experience is a clear indicator of change, but that changes in activation in response to cognitive training may be evidence of strategy change rather than indicative of neural plasticity. We note that the effect of cognitive training is surprisingly durable over time, but that the evidence that training effects transfer to other cognitive domains is relatively limited. We review evidence which suggests that engagement in an environment that requires sustained cognitive effort may facilitate cognitive function.},

	abstract = {This commentary highlights the critical role of sleep as a public health issue, particularly during a stressful life period such as the {COVID}-19 pandemic, and provides evidence-based practical guidelines to manage sleep disturbances during this crisis. The {COVID}19 pandemic and the imposed social confinement have produced significant stress, anxiety, and worries about health and the fear of being infected, jobs and financial problems, and uncertainty about the future. The incidence of sleep disturbances has also increased dramatically during this period. Aside from stress and anxiety, two other factors are likely to contribute to increased sleep disturbances during this crisis. First, alterations of our daily routines such as arising at a specific time, showing up at work, eating, exercising, and engaging in social and leisure activities at relatively fixed times are all important timekeepers for our sleep-wake cycles to remain synchronized with the day (light) and night (dark) cycles. Alterations of these timekeepers, combined with reduced daylight exposure, also essential to keep our biological clock synchronized, are likely to disrupt sleep and circadian rhythms. Sleep plays a fundamental role for mental and physical health, and adequate sleep duration and quality are essential for coping with major life events such as the {COVID}-19 pandemic. Public health education is warranted to keep the population well informed about the importance of sleep and healthy sleep practices in order to cope with the pandemic and prevent or minimize long-term adverse outcomes.},

	abstract = {Subject motion during {fMRI} can affect our ability to accurately measure signals of interest. In recent years, frame censoring—that is, statistically excluding motion-contaminated data within the general linear model using nuisance regressors—has appeared in several task-based {fMRI} studies as a mitigation strategy. However, there have been few systematic investigations quantifying its efficacy. In the present study, we compared the performance of frame censoring to several other common motion correction approaches for task-based {fMRI} using open data and reproducible workflows. We analyzed eight publicly available datasets representing 11 distinct tasks in child, adolescent, and adult participants. Performance was quantified using maximum t-values in group analyses, and region of interest–based mean activation and split-half reliability in single subjects. We compared frame censoring across several thresholds to the use of 6 and 24 canonical motion regressors, wavelet despiking, robust weighted least squares, and untrained {ICA}-based denoising, for a total of 240 separate analyses. Thresholds used to identify censored frames were based on both motion estimates ({FD}) and image intensity changes ({DVARS}). Relative to standard motion regressors, we found consistent improvements for modest amounts of frame censoring (e.g., 1–2\% data loss), although these gains were frequently comparable to what could be achieved using other techniques. Importantly, no single approach consistently outperformed the others across all datasets and tasks. These findings suggest that the choice of a motion mitigation strategy depends on both the dataset and the outcome metric of interest.},

Localized lesions and antagonist infusions demonstrate the anatomical locus of these cholinergic effects, and computational modeling links the function of cholinergic modulation to specific cellular effects within these regions. Acetylcholine has been shown to increase the strength of afferent input relative to feedback, to contribute to theta rhythm oscillations, activate intrinsic mechanisms for persistent spiking, and increase the modification of synapses. These effects might enhance different types of encoding in different cortical structures. In particular, the effects in entorhinal and perirhinal cortex and hippocampus might be important for encoding new episodic memories. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	volume = {101},
	abstract = {Clinical and experimental evidence suggests that hippocampal damage causes more severe disruption of episodic memories if those memories were encoded in the recent rather than the more distant past. This decrease in sensitivity to damage over time might reflect the formation of multiple traces within the hippocampus itself, or the formation of additional associative links in entorhinal and association cortices. Physiological evidence also supports a two-stage model of the encoding process in which the initial encoding occurs during active waking and deeper consolidation occurs via the formation of additional memory traces during quiet waking or slow-wave sleep. In this article I will describe the changes in cholinergic tone within the hippocampus in different stages of the sleep–wake cycle and will propose that these changes modulate different stages of memory formation. In particular, I will suggest that the high levels of acetylcholine that are present during active waking might set the appropriate dynamics for encoding new information in the hippocampus, by partially suppressing excitatory feedback connections and so facilitating encoding without interference from previously stored information. By contrast, the lower levels of acetylcholine that are present during quiet waking and slow-wave sleep might release this suppression and thereby allow a stronger spread of activity within the hippocampus itself and from the hippocampus to the entorhinal cortex, thus facilitating the process of consolidation of separate memory traces.},

This review focuses primarily on the findings of research investigating the role of the amygdala in modulating the consolidation of long-term memories. Considerable evidence from animal studies investigating the effects of posttraining systemic or intra-amygdala infusions of hormones and drugs, as well as selective lesions of specific amygdala nuclei, indicates that (a) the amygdala mediates the memory-modulating effects of adrenal stress hormones and several classes of neurotransmitters; (b) the effects are selectively mediated by the basolateral complex of the amygdala ({BLA}); (c) the influences involve interactions of several neuromodulatory systems within the {BLA} that converge in influencing noradrenergic and muscarinic cholinergic activation; (d) the {BLA} modulates memory consolidation via efferents to other brain regions, including the caudate nucleus, nucleus accumbens, and cortex; and (e) the {BLA} modulates the consolidation of memory of many different kinds of information. The findings of human brain imaging studies are consistent with those of animal studies in suggesting that activation of the amygdala influences the consolidation of long-term memory; the degree of activation of the amygdala by emotional arousal during encoding of emotionally arousing material (either pleasant or unpleasant) correlates highly with subsequent recall. The activation of neuromodulatory systems affecting the {BLA} and its projections to other brain regions involved in processing different kinds of information plays a key role in enabling emotionally significant experiences to be well remembered.},

Whether it likewise preserves or, to the contrary, depotentiates the emotional response associated with memory content is unclear, as there is conflicting evidence. In the current study, we investigated the influence of an afternoon nap (2-hr nap opportunity) on emotional responses of memories using multiple simultaneous measures. Young adults viewed 45 negative and 45 neutral pictures before taking a nap (measured with polysomnography) or remaining awake. Following the nap or wake period, participants viewed the same pictures intermixed with novel ones and indicated whether they remembered each picture. Emotional response to each picture was measured at both time points both subjectively, with valence and arousal ratings, and objectively, with recordings of electrodermal activity, electrocardiography, and corrugator supercilii electromyography. Compared to waking, a nap led to preserved subjective valence for negative pictures and preserved/increased skin conductance response in general. On the other hand, heart rate deceleration response decreased over the nap compared to wake interval, and this result was not influenced by picture type. These data suggest that sleep consolidates aspects of both subjective and physiological emotional response associated with episodic memory content. While sympathetic response appears to be preserved over sleep, parasympathetic response may be diminished.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE} To determine whether {ALAN} exposure while sleeping is associated with the prevalence and risk of obesity. {DESIGN}, {SETTING}, {AND} {PARTICIPANTS} This baseline and prospective analysis included women aged 35 to 74 years enrolled in the Sister Study in all 50 {US} states and Puerto Rico from July 2003 through March 2009. Follow-up was completed on August 14, 2015. A total of 43 722 women with no history of cancer or cardiovascular disease who were not shift workers, daytime sleepers, or pregnant at baseline were included in the analysis. Data were analyzed from September 1, 2017, through December 31, 2018. {EXPOSURES} Artificial light at night while sleeping reported at enrollment, categorized as no light, small nightlight in the room, light outside the room, and light or television in the room. {MAIN} {OUTCOMES} {AND} {MEASURES} Prevalent obesity at baseline was based on measured general obesity (body mass index [{BMI}] Ն30.0) and central obesity (waist circumference [{WC}] Ն88 cm, waist-to-hip ratio [{WHR}] Ն0.85, or waist-to-height ratio [{WHtR}]Ն0.5). To evaluate incident overweight and obesity, self-reported {BMI} at enrollment was compared with self-reported {BMI} at follow-up (mean [{SD}] follow-up, 5.7 [1.0] years). Generalized log-linear models with robust error variance were used to estimate multivariable-adjusted prevalence ratios ({PRs}) and relative risks ({RRs}) with 95\% {CIs} for prevalent and incident obesity.
{RESULTS} Among the population of 43 722 women (mean [{SD}] age, 55.4 [8.9] years), having any {ALAN} exposure while sleeping was positively associated with a higher prevalence of obesity at baseline, as measured using {BMI} ({PR}, 1.03; 95\% {CI}, 1.02-1.03), {WC} ({PR}, 1.12; 95\% {CI}, 1.09-1.16), {WHR} ({PR}, 1.04; 95\% {CI}, 1.00-1.08), and {WHtR} ({PR}, 1.07; 95\% {CI}, 1.04-1.09), after adjusting for confounding factors, with P {\textless} .001 for trend for each measure. Having any {ALAN} exposure while sleeping was also associated with incident obesity ({RR}, 1.19; 95\% {CI}, 1.06-1.34). Compared with no {ALAN}, sleeping with a television or a light on in the room was associated with gaining 5 kg or more ({RR}, 1.17; 95\% {CI}, 1.08-1.27; P {\textless} .001 for trend), a {BMI} increase of 10\% or more ({RR}, 1.13; 95\% {CI}, 1.02-1.26; P = .04 for trend), incident overweight ({RR}, 1.22; 95\% {CI},1.06-1.40; P = .03 for trend), and incident obesity ({RR}, 1.33; 95\% {CI}, 1.13-1.57; P {\textless} .001 for trend). Results were supported by sensitivity analyses and additional multivariable analyses including potential mediators such as sleep duration and quality, diet, and physical activity.
{CONCLUSIONS} {AND} {RELEVANCE} These results suggest that exposure to {ALAN} while sleeping may be a risk factor for weight gain and development of overweight or obesity. Further prospective and interventional studies could help elucidate this association and clarify whether lowering exposure to {ALAN} while sleeping can promote obesity prevention.},

Conversely, sleeping the second half of the night, which is dominated by rapid eye movement ({REM}) sleep, led to better discrimination between fear-relevant and neutral stimuli in behavioral and autonomic measures. Meanwhile, staying awake in the second half of the night led to an increase of discrimination between extinguished and neutral stimuli, which was paralleled by an activation of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and amygdala.

Design: Counterbalanced within-subject design. Setting: Three weekly visits to the sleep laboratory. Participants: Fourteen healthy participants aged between 20 and 30 years (8 women). Interventions: Motor sequence learning ({MSL}) task or motor control ({CTRL}) task before sleep. Measurements and Results: Subjects were trained on either the {MSL} or {CTRL} task in the evening and retested 12 hours later the following morning on the same task after a night of {PSG} sleep recording. Total number and duration of sleep spindles and spectral power between 0.5 and 24 Hz were quantified during {NREM} sleep. After performing the {MSL} task, subjects exhibited a large increase in number and duration of sleep spindles compared to after the {CTRL} task. Higher sigma (σ; 13 Hz) and beta (β; 18-20 Hz) spectral power during the post-training night's sleep were also observed after the {MSL} task. Conclusions: These results provide evidence that sleep spindles are involved in the offline consolidation of a new sequence of finger movements known to be sleep dependent. Moreover, they expand on prior findings by showing that changes in {NREM} sleep following motor learning are specific to consolidation (and learning), and not to nonspecific motor activity. Finally, these data demonstrate, for the first time, higher fast rhythms (β frequencies) during sleep after motor learning.},

	abstract = {As critical as waking brain function is to cognition, an extensive literature now indicates that sleep supports equally important, different yet complementary operations. This review will consider recent and emerging findings implicating sleep and specific sleep-stage physiologies in the modulation, regulation, and even preparation of cognitive and emotional brain processes. First, evidence for the role of sleep in memory processing will be discussed, principally focusing on declarative memory. Second, at a neural level several mechanistic models of sleep-dependent plasticity underlying these effects will be reviewed, with a synthesis of these features offered that may explain the ordered structure of sleep, and the orderly evolution of memory stages. Third, accumulating evidence for the role of sleep in associative memory processing will be discussed, suggesting that the long-term goal of sleep may not be the strengthening of individual memory items, but, instead, their abstracted assimilation into a schema of generalized knowledge. Fourth, the newly emerging benefit of sleep in regulating emotional brain reactivity will be considered. Finally, and building on this latter topic, a novel hypothesis and framework of sleep-dependent affective brain processing will be proposed, culminating in testable predictions and translational implications for mood disorders. © 2009 New York Academy of Sciences.},

	abstract = {Hippocampal cells that fire together during behaviour exhibit enhanced activity correlations during subsequent sleep, with some preservation of temporal order information. Thus, information reflecting experiences during behaviour is re–expressed in hippocampal circuits during subsequent ‘offline’ periods, as postulated by some theories of memory consolidation. If the hippocampus orchestrates the reinstatement of experience–specific activity patterns in the neocortex, as also postulated by such theories, then correlation patterns both within the neocortex and between hippocampus and neocortex should also re–emerge during sleep. Ensemble recordings were made in the posterior parietal neocortex, in {CA}1, and simultaneously in both areas, in seven rats. Each session involved an initial sleep episode (S1), behaviour on a simple maze (M), and subsequent sleep (S2). The ensemble activity–correlation structure within and between areas during S2 resembled that of M more closely than did the correlation pattern of S1. Temporal order (i.e. the asymmetry of the cross–correlogram) was also preserved within, but not between, structures. Thus, traces of recent experience are re–expressed in both hippocampal and neocortical circuits during sleep, and the representations in the two areas tend to correspond to the same experience. The poorer preservation of temporal firing biases between neurons in the different regions may reflect the less direct synaptic coupling between regions than within them. Alternatively, it could result from a shift, between behavioural states, in the relative dominance relations in the corticohippocampal dialogue. Between–structure order will be disrupted, for example, if, during behaviour, neocortical patterns tend to drive corresponding hippocampal patterns, whereas during sleep the reverse occurs. This possibility remains to be investigated.},

                    The two most common approaches for analysing count data are to use a generalized linear model (
                    {GLM}
                    ), or transform data, and use a linear model (
                    {LM}
                    ). The latter has recently been advocated to more reliably maintain control of type I error rates in tests for no association, while seemingly losing little in power. We make three points on this issue.
                  
                
                
                  
                    Point 1
                    – Choice of statistical model should primarily be made on the grounds of data properties. Choice of testing procedure should be considered and addressed as a separate issue, after model choice. If models with the appropriate data properties nonetheless have statistical problems such as type I error control (
                    i.e
                    . type I error rate greatly exceeds the intended significance level), the best solution is to keep the model but fix the problems.
                  
                
                
                  
                    Point 2
                    – When a test has problems with type I error control, it can usually be corrected, but this may require departure from software default approaches. In particular, resampling is a good solution for small samples that can be easy to implement.
                  
                
                
                  
                    Point 3
                    –Tests based on models that better fit the data (
                    e.g
                    . a negative binomial for overdispersed count data) tend to have better power properties and in some instances have considerably higher power.
                  
                
                
                  
                    We illustrate these issues for a 2 × 2 experiment with a count response. This seemingly simple problem becomes hard when the experimental design is unbalanced, and software default procedures using
                    {LM}
                    s or
                    {GLM}
                    s can have difficulties, although in both cases the issues can be fixed.
                  
                
                
                  
                    We conclude that, when
                    {GLM}
                    s are thought to fit count data well, and when any necessary steps are taken to correct type I error rates, they should be used rather than
                    {LM}
                    s. Nonetheless, standard
                    {LM}
                    tests are often robust and can have good type I error control, so there is an argument for their use for counts when diagnostics are difficult and statistical models are complex, although at some risk of loss of power and interpretability.},

	abstract = {It is well established that sleep deprivation, both acute total and chronic partial sleep restriction, results in significant impairment of neurobehavioral functioning. To quantify the magnitude of such changes, as well as to track the temporal profile in neurobehavioral degradation as sleep loss accumulates, a wide array of neurocognitive assays have been used. However, many of these tests are not well suited for assessment of performance across multiple sleep-wake cycles owing to significant inter- and intrasubject variability. To provide an accurate and useful measure of performance during sleep loss, and the expression of waking neurobehavioral integrity as it changes dynamically over time, neurocognitive assessments must validly and reliably reflect fundamental aspects of waking functions that are altered by sleep deprivation. Since such neurobehavioral assays will need to be administered to persons of different aptitudes and repeatedly over time, they should be devoid of substantial intersubject and intrasubject (e.g., learning) variability. Such assays should also provide meaningful outcome variables that can be easily interpreted relative to neurobiological and cognitive constructs. In this chapter we review one neurobehavioral assay that has met these criteria—the psychomotor vigilance task ({PVT}). 39},

              Stress-related disorders such as depression and anxiety are characterized by enhanced negative emotion and physiological dysfunction. Whilst elevated activity within area 25 of the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex ({sgACC}/25) has been implicated in these illnesses, it is unknown whether this over-activity is causal. By combining targeted intracerebral microinfusions with cardiovascular and behavioral monitoring in marmosets, we show that over-activation of {sgACC}/25 reduces vagal tone and heart rate variability, alters cortisol dynamics during stress and heightens reactivity to proximal and distal threat.

            Dysregulation of emotion is central to the etiology of mood disorders, such as depression. A causal understanding of how neural structures regulate emotion and arousal could help to improve treatments for these psychiatric disorders. Studies of patients with depression indicate that a particular part of the frontal lobe, the subgenual cingulate cortex, plays an important role in affective processing, though its precise contribution remains unclear. Here we show that, in macaque monkeys, this small part of the frontal cortex is necessary for sustaining elevated arousal in anticipation of positive emotional events. This finding suggests a mechanism for the contribution of this area to affective regulation, including an account for the lack of pleasure and passivity that characterizes mood disorders.
          , 
            The subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (subgenual {ACC}) plays an important role in regulating emotion, and degeneration in this area correlates with depressed mood and anhedonia. Despite this understanding, it remains unknown how this part of the prefrontal cortex causally contributes to emotion, especially positive emotions. Using Pavlovian conditioning procedures in macaque monkeys, we examined the contribution of the subgenual {ACC} to autonomic arousal associated with positive emotional events. After such conditioning, autonomic arousal increases in response to cues that predict rewards, and monkeys maintain this heightened state of arousal during an interval before reward delivery. Here we show that although monkeys with lesions of the subgenual {ACC} show the initial, cue-evoked arousal, they fail to sustain a high level of arousal until the anticipated reward is delivered. Control procedures showed that this impairment did not result from differences in autonomic responses to reward delivery alone, an inability to learn the association between cues and rewards, or to alterations in the light reflex. Our data indicate that the subgenual {ACC} may contribute to positive affect by sustaining arousal in anticipation of positive emotional events. A failure to maintain positive affect for expected pleasurable events could provide insight into the pathophysiology of psychological disorders in which negative emotions dominate a patient’s affective experience.},

However, modern life and work styles have led to much more time spent indoors, often with lower daytime and higher evening/nighttime light intensity from electrical lighting than outdoors. Whether this has long-term consequences for human health is being currently investigated. We tested if bright blue-enriched morning light over several days could counteract the detrimental effects of inadequate daytime and evening lighting. In a seminaturalistic, within-between subject study design, 18 young participants were exposed to different lighting conditions on 3 evenings (blue-enriched, bright orange, or dim light), after exposure to 2 lighting conditions (mixed blue-enriched light and control light, for 3 days each) in the mornings. Subjective sleepiness, reaction times, salivary melatonin concentrations, and nighttime sleep were assessed. Exposure to the blue-enriched morning lighting showed acute wake-promoting effects and faster reaction times than with control lighting. Some of these effects persisted until the evening, and performance improved over several days. The magnitude of circadian phase shifts induced by combinations of 3 different evening and 2 morning lighting conditions were significantly smaller with the blue-enriched morning light. During the night, participants had longer total sleep times after orange light exposure than after blue light exposure in the evening. Our results indicate that bright blue-enriched morning light stabilizes circadian phase, and it could be an effective counterstrategy for poor lighting during the day and also light exposure at the wrong time, such as in the late evening.},

            The use of light-emitting electronic devices for reading, communication, and entertainment has greatly increased recently. We found that the use of these devices before bedtime prolongs the time it takes to fall asleep, delays the circadian clock, suppresses levels of the sleep-promoting hormone melatonin, reduces the amount and delays the timing of {REM} sleep, and reduces alertness the following morning. Use of light-emitting devices immediately before bedtime also increases alertness at that time, which may lead users to delay bedtime at home. Overall, we found that the use of portable light-emitting devices immediately before bedtime has biological effects that may perpetuate sleep deficiency and disrupt circadian rhythms, both of which can have adverse impacts on performance, health, and safety.
          , 
            In the past 50 y, there has been a decline in average sleep duration and quality, with adverse consequences on general health. A representative survey of 1,508 American adults recently revealed that 90\% of Americans used some type of electronics at least a few nights per week within 1 h before bedtime. Mounting evidence from countries around the world shows the negative impact of such technology use on sleep. This negative impact on sleep may be due to the short-wavelength–enriched light emitted by these electronic devices, given that artificial-light exposure has been shown experimentally to produce alerting effects, suppress melatonin, and phase-shift the biological clock. A few reports have shown that these devices suppress melatonin levels, but little is known about the effects on circadian phase or the following sleep episode, exposing a substantial gap in our knowledge of how this increasingly popular technology affects sleep. Here we compare the biological effects of reading an electronic book on a light-emitting device ({LE}-{eBook}) with reading a printed book in the hours before bedtime. Participants reading an {LE}-{eBook} took longer to fall asleep and had reduced evening sleepiness, reduced melatonin secretion, later timing of their circadian clock, and reduced next-morning alertness than when reading a printed book. These results demonstrate that evening exposure to an {LE}-{eBook} phase-delays the circadian clock, acutely suppresses melatonin, and has important implications for understanding the impact of such technologies on sleep, performance, health, and safety.},

	abstract = {Sleep is crucial for recovery and skill acquisition in athletes. Paradoxically, athletes often encounter difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep, while having sufficient sleep opportunity. Blue (short-wavelength) light as emitted by electronic screens is considered a potential sleep thief, as it suppresses habitual melatonin secretion. The current study sought to investigate whether blocking short-wavelength light in the evening can improve sleep onset latency and potentially other sleep parameters among recreational athletes. The study had a within-subject crossover design. Fifteen recreational athletes, aged between 18 and 32 years (12 females, 3 males), were randomly assigned to start the intervention period with either the light restriction condition ({LR}; amber-lens glasses), or the no-light restriction condition ({nLR}; transparent glasses). Sleep hygiene practices, actigraphy and diary-based sleep estimates were monitored during four consecutive nights within each condition. Sleep hygiene practices did not significantly differ between conditions. Results indicate that blocking short-wavelength light in the evening, as compared to habitual light exposure, significantly shortened subjective sleep onset latency (Δ = 7 min), improved sleep quality (Δ = 0.6; scale 1–10), and increased alertness the following morning. Actigraphy-based sleep estimates showed no significant differences between conditions. Blocking short-wavelength light in the evening by means of amber-lens glasses is a cost-efficient and promising means to improve subjective sleep estimates among recreational athletes in their habitual home environment. The relatively small effects of the current study may be strengthened by additionally increasing morning- and daytime light exposure and, potentially, by reducing the alerting effects of media use before bedtime.},

Here, we demonstrate that a significant portion of neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex of freely behaving rats are phase locked to the hippocampal theta rhythm. In addition, we show that prefrontal neurons phase lock best to theta oscillations delayed by approximately 50 ms and confirm this hippocampo-prefrontal directionality and timing at the level of correlations between single cells. Finally, we find that phase locking of prefrontal cells is predicted by the presence of significant correlations with hippocampal cells at positive delays up to 150 ms. The theta-entrained activity across cortico-hippocampal circuits described here may be important for gating information flow and guiding the plastic changes that are believed to underlie the storage of information across these networks.},

	abstract = {Background: Rapid eye movement ({REM}) sleep has been postulated to facilitate emotional processing of negative stimuli. However, empirical evidence is mixed and the conditions under which higher amounts of {REM} sleep lead to decreased or increased emotional responses are unclear. We proposed that the time course between {REM} sleep and measurement of emotional responses is a crucial factor and hypothesized that more {REM} sleep will enhance emotional responses shortly after sleep, but will lead to decreased emotional responses in the long-term. Participants and Methods: Seventy-six healthy young women watched negative and neutral pictures before a polysomnographically-recorded nap including three different groups (1: no {REM} sleep, 2: {REM} sleep awakening, 3: {REM} sleep). Short-term emotional responses were measured using aversiveness ratings of negative pictures; aversiveness ratings of intrusive picture memories on the three subsequent evenings were used to measure long-term emotional responses.
Results: For short-term emotional responses, no significant interaction indicating group differences was found. However, we found correlations between longer {REM} sleep duration and higher aversiveness ratings of negative pictures. In contrast, lower aversiveness of intrusive picture memories after two days was found in participants with a full {REM} sleep period compared to individuals without {REM} sleep. Correlational analyses also supported this pattern of results.
Conclusions: Results suggest that {REM} sleep may increase reactivity to emotional stimuli in the short-term and this effect of {REM} sleep appears to facilitate emotional processing during subsequent nights leading to reduced intrusive picture memories in the long-term.},

Moreover, these cortical responses do not rely on voluntary evaluation of the hedonic content and are relatively unaffected by task demands. In this study, we examined modulation of the late positive potential as it varies with stimulus repetition. Three pictures (pleasant, neutral, unpleasant) were presented up to 60 times each. Although the amplitude of the late positive potential during picture viewing declined with stimulus repetition, affective modulation remained intact. On the other hand, autonomic responses (skin conductance and heart rate change) habituated rapidly with stimulus repetition. These findings suggest that while stimulus detection and categorization, reflected in the {LPP}, is mandatory, autonomic modulation reflects initial orienting responses that habituate rapidly.},

	abstract = {A {beneWcial} {eVect} of sleep after learning, compared to wakefulness, on memory formation has been shown in many studies using a variety of tasks. However, none of these studies has {speciWcally} addressed recognition memory for faces so far. The recognition of familiar faces, together with the extraction of emotional information from facial expression, is a fundamental cognitive skill in human everyday life, for which {speciWc} neural systems and mechanisms of processing have been developed. Here, we investigated the role of post-learning sleep for later recognition memory for neutral, happy, and angry faces. Twelve healthy subjects, after judging the emotional valence of the faces in the evening (learning phase), either slept normally in the subsequent night, with sleep recorded polysomnographically (sleep condition), or remained awake (wake condition) according to a cross-over design. Recognition testing took place in the second evening after learning, i.e. after a further night of regular sleep spent at home. Sleep after learning, compared to wakefulness, enhanced memory accuracy in recognition memory. This {eVect} was independent of the emotional valence of facial expression. The response criterion at recognition testing did not {diVer} between sleep and wake conditions. The amount of non rapid eye movement ({NonREM}) sleep during post-learning sleep correlated positively with memory accuracy at recognition testing, while time in {REM} sleep was associated with a speeded responding to the learned faces. Results suggest that face recognition, despite its dependence on specialized brain systems, nevertheless relies on the general neural mechanisms of sleep-associated memory consolidation.},

Methods: Twenty physically trained males underwent testing at 09:00 and 17:00 hours local time on 4 consecutive days at home (baseline) and the ﬁrst 4 days following 21 hours of air travel east across 8 time zones. In a randomized, matched-pairs design, participants traveled with ({INT}; n = 10) or without ({CON}; n = 10) a light exposure and sleep hygiene intervention. Performance was assessed via countermovement jump, 20-m sprint, T test, and Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery Level 1 tests, together with perceptual measures of jet lag, fatigue, mood, and motivation. Sleep was measured using wrist activity monitors in conjunction with self-report diaries. Results: Magnitude-based inference and standardized effect-size analysis indicated there was a very likely improvement in the mean change in countermovement jump peak power (effect size 1.10, ±0.55), and likely improvement in 5-m (0.54, ±0.67) and 20-m (0.74, ±0.71) sprint time in {INT} compared with {CON} across the 4 days posttravel. Sleep duration was most likely greater in {INT} both during travel (1.61, ±0.82) and across the 4 nights following travel (1.28, ±0.58) compared with {CON}. Finally, perceived mood and motivation were likely worse (0.73, ±0.88 and 0.63, ±0.87) across the 4 days posttravel in {CON} compared with {INT}. Conclusions: Combined light exposure and sleep hygiene improved speed and power but not intermittent-sprint performance up to 96 hours following long-haul transmeridian travel. The reduction of sleep disruption during and following travel is a likely contributor to improved performance.},

	abstract = {Over the past two decades, evidence has accumulated that the human amygdala exerts some of its functions also when the observer is not aware of the content, or even presence, of the triggering emotional stimulus. Nevertheless, there is as of yet no consensus on the limits and conditions that affect the extent of amygdala’s response without focused attention or awareness. Here we review past and recent studies on this subject, examining neuroimaging literature on healthy participants as well as braindamaged patients, and we comment on their strengths and limits. We propose a theoretical distinction between processes involved in attentional unawareness, wherein the stimulus is potentially accessible to enter visual awareness but fails to do so because attention is diverted, and in sensory unawareness, wherein the stimulus fails to enter awareness because its normal processing in the visual cortex is suppressed. We argue this distinction, along with data sampling amygdala responses with high temporal resolution, helps to appreciate the multiplicity of functional and anatomical mechanisms centered on the amygdala and supporting its role in non-conscious emotion processing. Separate, but interacting, networks relay visual information to the amygdala exploiting different computational properties of subcortical and cortical routes, thereby supporting amygdala functions at different stages of emotion processing. This view reconciles some apparent contradictions in the literature, as well as seemingly contrasting proposals, such as the dual stage and the dual route model. We conclude that evidence in favor of the amygdala response without awareness is solid, albeit this response originates from different functional mechanisms and is driven by more complex neural networks than commonly assumed. Acknowledging the complexity of such mechanisms can foster new insights on the varieties of amygdala functions without awareness and their impact on human behavior.},

	abstract = {We investigated the synchronization of fast spontaneous oscillations (mainly 30–40 Hz) in anesthetized and behaving cats by means of simultaneous extra- and intracellular recordings from multiple neocortical areas. Fast Fourier transforms, auto- and cross- correlations, and spike- or wave-triggered averages were used to determine the frequency and temporal coherence of fast oscillations that outlasted the stimulation of ascending activating systems or that occurred naturally during behavioral states of waking and rapid eye movement ({REM}) sleep but also appeared during the depolarizing phases of slow sleep oscillations. In 90\% of microelectrode tracks, the fast oscillations did not show field reversal at any depth of the cortex and were not observable in the underlying white matter. The negative field potentials of the fast oscillations were associated at all depths with neuronal firing. This field potential property of fast oscillations was in sharp contrast to the reversal of slow sleep oscillation or evoked potentials at depths of 0.25–0.5 mm. The coherence of fast spontaneous rhythms was spatially limited, being confined within a cortical column and among closely located neocortical sites, in contrast to the long- range synchronization of slow sleep rhythms. Depolarizing current pulses elicited spike-bursts (200–400 Hz) recurring at a frequency of 30–40 Hz. Our experiments demonstrate that the conventional notion of a totally desynchronized cortical activity upon arousal should be revised as fast rhythms are enhanced and synchronized within intracortical networks during brain activation. Spontaneously occurring, subthreshold membrane potential depolarizing oscillations may bias cortical and thalamic neurons to respond synchronously, at fast frequencies, to relevant stimuli in the wake state or to internally generated drives in {REM} sleep.},

Depending on the interstimulus interval, {PAS} can induce a long-term potentiation ({LTP})-like facilitation or long-term depression ({LTD})-like suppression of cortical excitability. In three experimental sessions, 12 awake men received {PAS} of the right median nerve and left M1HAND in the evening before sleep. To optimize the timing of paired stimulation in M1HAND, the interstimulus interval of {PAS} was adjusted to the individual N20-latency of the somatosensory evoked potential to induce {LTP}-like effects ({PASN}20+2ms), {LTD}-like effects ({PASN}20)5ms), or no timing-dependent after-effects ({PAScontrol}). Motor-evoked potentials ({MEPs}) showed high interindividual variations in the conditioning effects of {PASN}20+2ms and {PASN}20)5ms on cortical excitability. However, {PAScontrol} allowed us to adjust for any unspeciﬁc stimulation effects and the {MEP} increase after {PASN}20+2ms differed signiﬁcantly from the {MEP} decrease after {PASN}20)5ms. {PASN}20+2ms and {PASN}20)5ms also had a differential effect on regional expression of slow waves and slow spindle activity during the ﬁrst hour of subsequent non-rapid eye movement ({NREM}) sleep. At the electrode sites overlying the conditioned M1HAND and the adjacent premotor cortex, local expression of slow spindle activity was signiﬁcantly correlated with interindividual differences in the efﬁcacy of {PASN}20+2ms and {PASN}20)5ms to potentiate or suppress cortical excitability. This correlation indicates that {PAS} shapes the local regulation of slow sleep spindles during subsequent {NREM} sleep.},

	abstract = {Recent accumulating evidence in animals and humans has shown that memory strengthening occurs, at least partially, during sleep [1, 2] and relies on the covert reactivation of individual memory episodes [3–5]. However, it remains to be determined whether the hippocampus critically promotes memory consolidation via the reactivation of individual memories during sleep. To investigate the hippocampal-dependent nature of this phenomenon in humans, we selected two groups of chronic temporal lobe epileptic ({TLE}) patients with selective unilateral ({TLE}+{UHS}) or bilateral ({TLE}+{BHS}) hippocampal sclerosis and a group of matched healthy controls, and we requested them to learn the association of sounds cueing the appearance of words. On the basis of other similar behavioral paradigms in healthy populations [4, 6], sounds that cued only half of the learned memories were presented again during the slow-wave sleep stage ({SWS}) at night, thus promoting memory reactivation of a select set of encoded episodes. A memory test administered on the subsequent day showed that the strengthening of reactivated memories was observed only in the control subjects and {TLE}+{UHS} patients. Importantly, the amount of memory strengthening was predicted by the volume of spared hippocampus. Thus, the greater the structural integrity of the hippocampus, the higher the degree of memory beneﬁt driven by memory reactivation. Finally, sleep-speciﬁc neurophysiological responses, such as spindles and slow waves, differed between the sample groups, and the spindle density during {SWS} predicted the degree of memory beneﬁt observed on day 2. Taken together, these ﬁndings demonstrate that the hippocampus plays a crucial role in the consolidation of memories via covert reactivation during sleep.},

Here, we tested for the first time whether verbal cueing during sleep can improve vocabulary learning. We cued prior learned Dutch words either during nonrapid eye movement sleep ({NonREM}) or during active or passive waking. Re-exposure to Dutch words during sleep improved later memory for the German translation of the cued words when compared with uncued words. Recall of uncued words was similar to an additional group receiving no verbal cues during sleep. Furthermore, verbal cueing failed to improve memory during active and passive waking. Highdensity electroencephalographic recordings revealed that successful verbal cueing during {NonREM} sleep is associated with a pronounced frontal negativity in event-related potentials, a higher frequency of frontal slow waves as well as a cueing-related increase in right frontal and left parietal oscillatory theta power. Our results indicate that verbal cues presented during {NonREM} sleep reactivate associated memories, and facilitate later recall of foreign vocabulary without impairing ongoing consolidation processes. Likewise, our oscillatory analysis suggests that both sleep-specific slow waves as well as theta oscillations (typically associated with successful memory encoding during wakefulness) might be involved in strengthening memories by cueing during sleep.},

Considering that wakefulness and sleep are profoundly different brain states on multiple levels (e.g., cellular, molecular and network activation), it is unlikely that they operate exactly the same way. Rather it is probable that they engage different, but coordinated, mechanisms. In this article we discuss how plasticity may be divided across the sleep–wake cycle, and how synaptic changes in each brain state are linked. Our working model proposes that waking experience triggers short-lived synaptic events that are necessary for transient plastic changes and mark (i.e., ‘prime’) circuits and synapses for further processing in sleep. During sleep, synaptic protein synthesis at primed synapses leads to structural changes necessary for long-term information storage.},

In the present study, we investigated the relative impacts of nocturnal {SWS} and {REM} upon the consolidation of emotional memories using functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) and polysomnography ({PSG}). Participants encoded emotionally positive, negative, and neutral images (remote memories) before a night of {PSG}-monitored sleep. Twenty-four hours later, they encoded a second set of images (recent memories) immediately before a recognition test in an {MRI} scanner. {SWS} predicted superior memory for remote negative images and a reduction in right hippocampal responses during the recollection of these items. {REM}, however, predicted an overnight increase in hippocampal–neocortical connectivity associated with negative remote memory. These ﬁndings provide physiological support for sequential views of sleep-dependent memory processing, demonstrating that {SWS} and {REM} serve distinct but complementary functions in consolidation. Furthermore, these ﬁndings extend those ideas to emotional memory by showing that, once selectively reorganized away from the hippocampus during {SWS}, emotionally aversive representations undergo a comparably targeted process during subsequent {REM}.},

Here we demonstrate that the {TWAA} learning training trials activate P-wave generator, and increase phosphorylation of {CREB} ({pCREB}) and expression of activity-regulated cytoskeletal-associated (Arc) protein, as well as messenger ribonucleic acid ({mRNAs}) of Arc, brain-derived nerve growth factor ({BDNF}) and early growth response-1 (Egr-1) in the {DH} and amygdala. Selective elimination of P-wave-generating cells abolished P-wave activity and suppressed {TWAA} learning training trialinduced expression of {pCREB} and Arc proteins and Arc, {BDNF} and Egr-1 {mRNAs} in the {DH} and amygdala. Following a session of {TWAA} training, all rats were equal in terms of time spent in wakefulness, slow-wave sleep and rapid eye movement ({REM}) sleep irrespective of P-wave lesions. The second set of experiments demonstrated that localized cholinergic stimulation of the P-wave generator increased expression of Arc, {BDNF} and Egr-1 {mRNAs} in the {DH}. Together, these findings provide the first direct evidence that activation of P-wave-generating cells is critically involved in the {TWAA} training trial-induced expression of plasticity-related genes in the {DH} and amygdala.

We aimed to investigate how whole-night bedside light can affect sleep quality and brain activity. Patients and methods: Ten healthy sleepers underwent two polysomnography ({PSG}) sessions, one with the lights off and one with the lights on. {PSG} variables related to sleep quality were extracted and compared between lights-off and lights-on sleep. Spectral analysis was performed to rapid eye movement ({REM}) sleep and non-{REM} ({NREM}) sleep epochs to reveal any light-induced differences in background brain rhythms.
Results: Lights-on sleep was associated with increased stage 1 sleep (N1), decreased slow-wave sleep ({SWS}), and increased arousal index. Spectral analysis revealed that theta power (4–8 Hz) during {REM} sleep and slow oscillation (0.5–1 Hz), delta (1–4 Hz), and spindle (10–16 Hz) power during {NREM} sleep were decreased in lights-on sleep conditions.
Conclusions: Sleeping with the light on not only causes shallow sleep and frequent arousals but also has a persistent effect on brain oscillations, especially those implicated in sleep depth and stability. Our study demonstrates additional hazardous effect of light pollution on health.},

Mood disorders are often associated with disrupted circadian clock-controlled responses, such as sleep and cortisol secretion, whereas disruption of circadian rhythms via jet lag, night-shift work, or exposure to artiﬁcial light at night, can precipitate or exacerbate affective symptoms in susceptible individuals. Evidence suggests strong associations between circadian rhythms and mental health, but only recently have studies begun to discover the direct interactions between the circadian system and mood regulation. This review provides an overview of disrupted circadian rhythms and the relationship to behavioral health and psychiatry. The focus of this review is delineating the role of disruption of circadian rhythms on mood disorders using human night shift studies, as well as jet lag studies to identify links.

            Ambient nighttime light exposure is implicated as a risk factor for adverse health outcomes, including cardiometabolic disease. However, the effects of nighttime light exposure during sleep on cardiometabolic outcomes and the related mechanisms are unclear. This laboratory study shows that, in healthy adults, one night of moderate (100 lx) light exposure during sleep increases nighttime heart rate, decreases heart rate variability (higher sympathovagal balance), and increases next-morning insulin resistance when compared to sleep in a dimly lit ({\textless}3 lx) environment. Moreover, a positive relationship between higher sympathovagal balance and insulin levels suggests that sympathetic activation may play a role in the observed light-induced changes in insulin sensitivity.
          , 
            
              This study tested the hypothesis that acute exposure to light during nighttime sleep adversely affects next-morning glucose homeostasis and whether this effect occurs via reduced sleep quality, melatonin suppression, or sympathetic nervous system ({SNS}) activation during sleep. A total of 20 young adults participated in this parallel-group study design. The room light condition (
              n
              = 10) included one night of sleep in dim light ({\textless}3 lx) followed by one night of sleep with overhead room lighting (100 lx). The dim light condition (
              n
              = 10) included two consecutive nights of sleep in dim light. Measures of insulin resistance (morning homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, 30-min insulin area under the curve [{AUC}] from a 2-h oral glucose tolerance test) were higher in the room light versus dim light condition. Melatonin levels were similar in both conditions. In the room light condition, participants spent proportionately more time in stage N2 and less in slow wave and rapid eye movement sleep. Heart rate was higher and heart rate variability lower (higher sympathovagal balance) during sleep in the room light versus the dim light condition. Importantly, the higher sympathovagal balance during sleep was associated with higher 30-min insulin {AUC}, consistent with increased insulin resistance the following morning. These results demonstrate that a single night of exposure to room light during sleep can impair glucose homeostasis, potentially via increased {SNS} activation. Attention to avoiding exposure to light at night during sleep may be beneficial for cardiometabolic health.},

Indeed, intervening memory reactivation may regulate memory longevity, and a growing body of evidence implicates sleep in changing memory storage. For example, subtle auditory stimulation can be used experimentally to selectively encourage memory reactivation during sleep, which thereby improves learning. Much remains to be elucidated about how learning depends on sleep. Nevertheless, this methodology for modifying memory storage during sleep offers new opportunities for reinforcing learning to enhance clinical outcomes in conjunction with therapies engaged during waking. A variety of such possibilities must now be carefully investigated. Likewise, brain rhythms can be entrained to enhance sleep functions, facilitating further progress in understanding the neurophysiological basis of memory processing during sleep. Ultimately, empirical evidence may reveal the extent to which the way we behave when awake is a function of what our brains do when we are asleep. Through such research efforts, an advanced understanding of memory and sleep may allow us to both make better use of our time asleep and take steps toward better health.},

In the first two experiments, a flexible and dynamic lighting system is used in quasi-experimental field studies using data from 89 pupils from two schools (Study 1) and 37 pupils from two classrooms (Study 2). The third experiment evaluated two lighting settings within a school-simulating, windowless laboratory setting (n = 55). The results indicate a positive influence of the lighting system on pupils’ concentration. The findings underline the importance of lighting for learning.

              Ample research has shown that light influences our emotions, cognition, and sleep quality. However, little work has examined whether different light exposure-related behaviors, such as daytime exposure to electric light and nighttime usage of gadgets, especially before sleep, influence sleep quality and cognition. Three-hundred-and-one Malaysian adults (Mean
              Age±{SD}
               = 28 ± 9) completed the Light Exposure Behavior Assessment tool that measured five light exposure behaviors. They also completed the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire, Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and single items assessing trouble in memory and concentration. A partial least square structural equation model, showing 72.72\% predictive power, revealed that less use of wearable blue filters outdoors during the day and more within one hour before sleep predicted early peak time (direct effect = −0.25). Increased time spent outdoors predicted a positive affect (direct effect = 0.33) and a circadian phase advancement (direct effect: rising time = 0.14, peak time = 0.20, retiring time = 0.17). Increased use of mobile phone before sleep predicted a circadian phase delay (direct effect: retiring time = −0.25; rising time = −0.23; peak time = −0.22; morning affect = −0.12), reduced sleep quality (direct effect = 0.13), and increased trouble in memory and concentration (total effect = 0.20 and 0.23, respectively). Increased use of tunable, {LED}, or dawn-simulating electric light in the morning and daytime predicted a circadian phase advancement (direct effect: peak time = 0.15, morning affect = 0.14, retiring time = 0.15) and good sleep quality (direct effect = −0.16). The results provide valuable insights into developing a healthy light diet to promote health and wellness.},

            Sleep supports memory consolidation as well as next-day learning. The influential “Active Systems” account of offline consolidation suggests that sleep-associated memory processing paves the way for new learning, but empirical evidence in support of this idea is scarce. Using a within-subjects (n = 30), crossover design, we assessed behavioral and electrophysiological indices of episodic encoding after a night of sleep or total sleep deprivation in healthy adults (aged 18–25 years) and investigated whether behavioral performance was predicted by the overnight consolidation of episodic associations from the previous day. Sleep supported memory consolidation and next-day learning as compared to sleep deprivation. However, the magnitude of this sleep-associated consolidation benefit did not significantly predict the ability to form novel memories after sleep. Interestingly, sleep deprivation prompted a qualitative change in the neural signature of encoding: Whereas 12–20 Hz beta desynchronization—an established marker of successful encoding—was observed after sleep, sleep deprivation disrupted beta desynchrony during successful learning. Taken together, these findings suggest that effective learning depends on sleep but not necessarily on sleep-associated consolidation.},

The slow wave activity ({SWA}) that is a hallmark of slow wave sleep could be involved in both functions. Here, we aimed to demonstrate a causative role for {SWA} in enhancing the capacity for encoding of information during subsequent wakefulness, using transcranial slow oscillation stimulation ({tSOS}) oscillating at 0.75 Hz to induce {SWA} in healthy humans during an afternoon nap. Encoding following the nap was tested for hippocampusdependent declarative materials (pictures, word pairs, and word lists) and procedural skills (ﬁnger sequence tapping). As compared with a sham stimulation control condition, {tSOS} during the nap enhanced {SWA} and signiﬁcantly improved subsequent encoding on all three declarative tasks (picture recognition, cued recall of word pairs, and free recall of word lists), whereas procedural ﬁnger sequence tapping skill was not affected. Our results indicate that sleep {SWA} enhances the capacity for encoding of declarative materials, possibly by down-scaling hippocampal synaptic networks that were potentiated towards saturation during the preceding period of wakefulness.},

As hormones mediate individual responses to changing environments, endocrine systems might be one of the first systems affected, as well as being the first line of defense to ameliorate any negative health impacts. In this Review, we first highlight how light can influence endocrine function in vertebrates. We then focus on four endocrine axes that might be affected by artificial light at night ({ALAN}): pineal, reproductive, adrenal and thyroid. Throughout, we highlight key findings, rather than performing an exhaustive review, in order to emphasize knowledge gaps that are hindering progress on proposing impactful and concrete plans to ameliorate the negative effects of {ALAN}. We discuss these findings with respect to impacts on human and animal health, with a focus on the consequences of anthropogenic modification of the night-time environment for nonhuman organisms. Lastly, we stress the need for the integration of field and lab experiments as well as the need for long-term integrative eco-physiological studies in the rapidly expanding field of light pollution.},

At baseline, 60 items of the Compound Remote Associate ({CRA}) task were presented. At retest after the experimental conditions, the same items were presented again together with 20 new control items to disentangle off-line incubation from online performance effects.
Results: Sleep significantly strengthened formerly encoded memories in comparison to both wake conditions (improvement in speed of correctly resolved items). Offline reorganization was not enhanced following sleep, but was enhanced following sleep-deprivation in comparison to sleep and daytime wakefulness (solution time of previously incubated, newly solved items). Online performance did not differ between the groups (solution time of new control items).
Conclusions: The results support the notion that sleep promotes the strengthening, but not the reorganization, of newly encoded memory traces in a verbal creativity task. Future studies are needed to further determine the impact of sleep on different types of memory reorganization, such as associative thinking, creativity and emotional memory processing, and potential clinical translations, such as the augmentation of psychotherapy through sleep interventions.},

	abstract = {The main goal of the present study was to explore the role of sleep in the process of ill-deﬁned problem solving. The results of previous studies indicate that various cognitive processes are largely dependent on the quality and quantity of sleep. However, while sleep-related memory consolidation seems to be well-grounded, with regard to the impact of sleep on problem solving, existing research yields mixed and rather inconclusive results. Moreover, this effect has been mainly tested using simple and well-deﬁned, common laboratory problems, such as the remote associate test ({RAT}), crossword and anagram puzzles, numeric and logic problems, etc. What is lacking is research on the effect of sleep on solving more complex and more real-life oriented ill-deﬁned problems. In the present study, we hypothesized that sleep can improve performance in solving this kind of problems. The study involved 40 participants, randomly assigned to two experimental conditions: sleep group and waking group. The experimental protocol comprised three stages: problem presentation, retention interval, and testing stage. The problem was presented to the participants in the form of an interactive computer game concerning a complex, elaborate crime story. During the retention interval, the participants—depending on the condition—took a nap or stayed awake; sleeping participants underwent polysomnography recording, while waking participants performed activities not related to the experimental problem. In the testing stage, participants tried to solve the presented problem. The solutions generated were assessed both for quality (reasonableness, consistency, and story recall) and creativity (ﬂuency, ﬂexibility, originality, and elaboration). Contrary to expectations, we found no effect of sleep on ill-deﬁned problem solving. Neither quality nor creativity of the solutions generated by the participants was higher in the nap group than in the waking group. There were also no performance improvements with regard to any sleep stage or incidence of dreams. Our study adds to a growing body of evidence that sleep probably might provide an incubation gap, but not a facilitating environment serving the purpose of problem solving, at least with regard to ill-deﬁned problems.},

However, we know little about whether sleep plays a role in the processing of a fundamental feature of declarative memory, relational memory – the ﬂexible representation of items not directly learned prior to sleep. Thirty-one healthy participants ﬁrst learned at 12 pm two sets of face–object photograph pairs (direct associative memory), in which the objects in each pair were common to both lists, but paired with two different faces. Participants either were given approximately 90 min to have a {NREM}-only daytime nap (n = 14) or an equivalent waking period (n = 17). At 4:30 pm, participants who napped demonstrated signiﬁcantly better retention of direct associative memory, as well as better performance on a surprise task assessing their relational memory, in which participants had to associate the two faces previously paired with the same object during learning. Particularly noteworthy, relational memory performance was correlated with the amount of {NREM} sleep during the nap, with only slow-wave sleep predicting relational memory performance. Sleep stage data did not correlate with direct associative memory retention. These results suggest an active role for sleep in facilitating multiple processes that are not limited to the mere strengthening of rote memories, but also the binding of items that were not directly learned together, reorganizing them for ﬂexible use at a later time.},

It is known that sleeping after learning a declarative or non-declarative task, is better than remaining awake. Furthermore, there are reports of a possible role for dreams in consolidation of declarative memories. Other studies have reported the effect of naps on memory consolidation. With similar protocols, another set of studies indicated that sleep has a role in creativity and problem-solving. Here we hypothesised that sleep can increase the likelihood of solving problems. After struggling to solve a video game problem, subjects who took a nap (n = 14) were almost twice as likely to solve it when compared to the wake control group (n = 15). It is interesting to note that, in the nap group 9 out 14 subjects engaged in slow-wave sleep ({SWS}) and all solved the problem. Surprisingly, we did not find a significant involvement of Rapid Eye Movement ({REM}) sleep in this task. Slowwave sleep is believed to be crucial for the transfer of memory-related information to the neocortex and implement intentions. Sleep can benefit problem-solving through the generalisation of newly encoded information and abstraction of the gist. In conclusion, our results indicate that sleep, even a nap, can potentiate the solution of problems that involve logical reasoning. Thus, sleep’s function seems to go beyond memory consolidation to include managing of everyday-life events.},

We recorded neuronal activity in both regions in rhesus macaques performing a token-gambling task. We find that both encode many of the same variables; including integrated offered values of gambles, primary as well as secondary reward outcomes, number of current tokens, and anticipated rewards. Both regions exhibit memory traces for offer values and putative value-comparison signals. Both regions use a consistent scheme to encode the value of the attended option. This result suggests that neurons do not appear to be specialized for specific offers (that is, neurons use an attentional as opposed to labeled line coding scheme). We also observed some differences between the two regions: (1) coding strengths in {dACC} were consistently greater than those in {sgACC}, (2) neurons in {sgACC} responded especially to losses and in anticipation of primary rewards, while those in {dACC} showed more balanced responding, and (3) responses to the first offer were slightly faster in {sgACC}. These results indicate that {sgACC} and {dACC} have some functional overlap in economic choice, and are consistent with the idea, inspired by neuroanatomy, that {sgACC} may serve as input to {dACC}.},

However, it remains unclear if positive-social emotion upregulation of the amygdala occurs directly through the dorsomedial {PFC} ({dmPFC}) or indirectly linking the bilateral amygdala with the {dmPFC} via the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex ({sgACC}), an area which typically serves as a gatekeeper between cognitive and emotion networks.

	abstract = {In the 40 years since Aaron Beck first proposed his cognitive model of depression, the elements of this model — biased attention, biased processing, biased thoughts and rumination, biased memory, and dysfunctional attitudes and schemas — have been consistently linked with the onset and maintenance of depression. Although numerous studies have examined the neural mechanisms that underlie the cognitive aspects of depression, their findings have not been integrated with Beck’s cognitive model. In this Review, we identify the functional and structural neurobiological architecture of Beck’s cognitive model of depression. Although the mechanisms underlying each element of the model differ, in general the negative cognitive biases in depression are facilitated by increased influence from subcortical emotion processing regions combined with attenuated top-down cognitive control.},

	abstract = {Background: Light exposure can cascade numerous effects on the human circadian process via the non-imaging forming system, whose spectral relevance is highest in the short-wavelength range. Here we investigated if commercially available compact fluorescent lamps with different colour temperatures can impact on alertness and cognitive performance.
Methods: Sixteen healthy young men were studied in a balanced cross-over design with light exposure of 3 different light settings (compact fluorescent lamps with light of 40 lux at 6500K and at 2500K and incandescent lamps of 40 lux at 3000K) during 2 h in the evening.
Results: Exposure to light at 6500K induced greater melatonin suppression, together with enhanced subjective alertness, well-being and visual comfort. With respect to cognitive performance, light at 6500K led to significantly faster reaction times in tasks associated with sustained attention (Psychomotor Vigilance and {GO}/{NOGO} Task), but not in tasks associated with executive function (Paced Visual Serial Addition Task). This cognitive improvement was strongly related with attenuated salivary melatonin levels, particularly for the light condition at 6500K.
Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the sensitivity of the human alerting and cognitive response to polychromatic light at levels as low as 40 lux, is blue-shifted relative to the three-cone visual photopic system. Thus, the selection of commercially available compact fluorescent lights with different colour temperatures significantly impacts on circadian physiology and cognitive performance at home and in the workplace.},

	abstract = {Acute exposure to light within the blue wavelengths has been shown to enhance alertness and vigilance, and lead to improved speed on reaction time tasks, possibly due to activation of the noradrenergic system. It remains unclear, however, whether the effects of blue light extend beyond simple alertness processes to also enhance other aspects of cognition, such as memory performance. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a thirty minute pulse of blue light versus placebo (amber light) exposure in healthy normally rested individuals in the morning during verbal memory consolidation (i.e., 1.5 hours after memory acquisition) using an abbreviated version of the California Verbal Learning Test ({CVLT}-{II}). At delayed recall, individuals who received blue light (n = 12) during the consolidation period showed significantly better long-delay verbal recall than individuals who received amber light exposure (n = 18), while controlling for the effects of general intelligence, depressive symptoms and habitual wake time. These findings extend previous work demonstrating the effect of blue light on brain activation and alertness to further demonstrate its effectiveness at facilitating better memory consolidation and subsequent retention of verbal material. Although preliminary, these findings point to a potential application of blue wavelength light to optimize memory performance in healthy populations. It remains to be determined whether blue light exposure may also enhance performance in clinical populations with memory deficits.},

	abstract = {In addition to classical visual effects, light elicits nonvisual brain responses, which profoundly inﬂuence physiology and behavior. These effects are mediated in part by melanopsin-expressing lightsensitive ganglion cells that, in contrast to the classical photopic system that is maximally sensitive to green light (550 nm), is very sensitive to blue light (470--480 nm). At present, there is no evidence that blue light exposure is effective in modulating nonvisual brain activity related to complex cognitive tasks. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we show that, while participants perform an auditory working memory task, a short (18 min) daytime exposure to blue (470 nm) or green (550 nm) monochromatic light (3 3 1013 photons/cm2/s) differentially modulates regional brain responses. Blue light typically enhanced brain responses or at least prevented the decline otherwise observed following green light exposure in frontal and parietal cortices implicated in working memory, and in the thalamus involved in the modulation of cognition by arousal. Our results imply that monochromatic light can affect cognitive functions almost instantaneously and suggest that these effects are mediated by a melanopsin-based photoreceptor system.},

	abstract = {Study Objectives: To assess the wavelength-dependent sensitivity of the acute effects of ocular light exposure on alertness, performance, waking electroencephalogram ({EEG}), and cortisol. Design: A between-subjects design was employed to compare the effects of exposure to 460-nm or 555-nm light for 6.5 hours during the biological night. Setting: Intensive Physiological Monitoring Unit, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston, {MA}. Patients and Participants: Sixteen healthy adults (8 women; mean age ± {SD} = 23.3 ± 2.4 years). Interventions: Subjects were exposed to equal photon densities (2.8 x 1013 photons• cm-2• s-1) of either 460-nm (n = 8) or 555-nm (n = 8) monochromatic light for 6.5 hours, 15 minutes after mydriasis. Measurements and Results: Subjects underwent continuous {EEG}/electrooculogram recordings and completed a performance battery every 30 to 60 minutes. As compared with those exposed to 555-nm light, subjects exposed to 460-nm light had signiﬁcantly lower subjective sleepiness ratings, decreased auditory reaction time, fewer attentional failures, decreased {EEG} power density in the delta-theta range (0.5-5.5 Hz), and increased {EEG} power density in the high-alpha range (9.5-10.5 Hz). Light had no direct effect on cortisol. Conclusions: Short-wavelength sensitivity to the acute alerting effects of light indicates that the visual photopic system is not the primary photoreceptor system mediating these responses to light. The frequency-speciﬁc changes in the waking {EEG} indicate that short-wavelength light is a powerful agent that immediately attenuates the negative effects of both homeostatic sleep pressure and the circadian drive for sleep on alertness, performance, and the ability to sustain attention.},

Therefore, the present meta-analysis considered 48 studies with a total of 53 sleep (n = 829) and 53 wake (n = 825) groups. An overall comparison between all sleep and wake groups resulted in a small effect for the relative sleep gain in motor memory consolidation (g = 0.43). While no sub­ group differences were identified for differing designs, a small effect for the finger tapping task (g = 0.47) and a medium effect for the mirror tracing task (g = 0.62) were found. In summary, the meta-analysis substantiates that sleep generally benefits the consolidation of motor memories. However, to further our understanding of the mechanisms underlying this effect, examining certain task dimensions and their relative sleep gain would be a promising direction for future research.},

The dual-process model hypothesises that psychological therapy is associated with increased emotional-regulation in prefrontal brain regions and decreased implicit emotional-reactivity in limbic regions; however, research has yielded inconsistent ﬁndings. Meta-analyses of brain activity changes accompanying psychological therapy (22 studies, n = 352) and neural predictors of symptomatic improvement (11 studies, n = 293) in depression and anxiety were conducted using seed-based d mapping. Both resting-state and task-based studies were included, and analysed together and separately. The most robust ﬁndings were signiﬁcant decreases in anterior cingulate/paracingulate gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus and insula activation after therapy. Cuneus activation was predictive of subsequent symptom change. The results are in agreement with neural models of improved emotional-reactivity following therapy as evidenced by decreased activity within the anterior cingulate and insula. We propose compensatory as well as corrective neural mechanisms of action underlie therapeutic eﬃcacy, and suggest the dual-process model may be too simplistic to account fully for treatment mechanisms. More research on predictors of psychotherapeutic response is required to provide reliable predictors of response.},

	abstract = {The orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala are involved in emotion and in motivation, but the relationship between these functions performed by these brain structures is not clear. To address this, a unified theory of emotion and motivation is described in which motivational states are states in which instrumental goal-directed actions are performed to obtain rewards or avoid punishers, and emotional states are states that are elicited when the reward or punisher is or is not received. This greatly simplifies our understanding of emotion and motivation, for the same set of genes and associated brain systems can define the primary or unlearned rewards and punishers such as sweet taste or pain. Recent evidence on the connectivity of human brain systems involved in emotion and motivation indicates that the orbitofrontal cortex is involved in reward value and experienced emotion with outputs to cortical regions including those involved in language, and is a key brain region involved in depression and the associated changes in motivation. The amygdala has weak effective connectivity back to the cortex in humans, and is implicated in brainstem-mediated responses to stimuli such as freezing and autonomic activity, rather than in declarative emotion. The anterior cingulate cortex is involved in learning actions to obtain rewards, and with the orbitofrontal cortex and ventromedial prefrontal cortex in providing the goals for navigation and in reward-related effects on memory consolidation mediated partly via the cholinergic system.},

These intrinsic connectivity networks showed dissociable correlations with functions measured outside the scanner. Prescan anxiety ratings correlated with intrinsic functional connectivity of the {dACC} node of the salience network, but with no region in the executive-control network, whereas executive task performance correlated with lateral parietal nodes of the executive-control network, but with no region in the salience network.

Building on this clinical evidence, recent neurobiological frameworks have hypothesized a beneﬁt of {REM} sleep in palliatively decreasing next-day brain reactivity to recent waking emotional experiences [5, 6]. Speciﬁcally, the marked suppression of central adrenergic neurotransmitters during {REM} (commonly implicated in arousal and stress), coupled with activation in amygdala-hippocampal networks that encode salient events, is proposed to (re) process and depotentiate previous affective experiences, decreasing their emotional intensity [3]. In contrast, the failure of such adrenergic reduction during {REM} sleep has been described in anxiety disorders, indexed by persistent high-frequency electroencephalographic ({EEG}) activity ({\textgreater}30 Hz) [7–10]; a candidate factor contributing to hyperarousal and exaggerated amygdala reactivity [3, 11–13]. Despite these neurobiological frameworks, and their predictions, the proposed beneﬁt of {REM} sleep physiology in depotentiating neural and behavioral responsivity to prior emotional events remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that {REM} sleep physiology is associated with an overnight dissipation of amygdala activity in response to previous emotional experiences, altering functional connectivity and reducing next-day subjective emotionality.},

Empirical analyses of artiﬁcial data sets are used to illustrate key points throughout. The article provides a number of practical recommendations designed to facilitate centering decisions in {MLM} applications.},

	abstract = {Major Depressive Disorder has been associated with volumetric abnormality in the amygdala. In this meta-analysis we examine results from magnetic resonance imaging volumetry studies of the amygdala in depression in order to assess both the nature of the relationship between depression and amygdala volume as well as the influence of extra-experimental factors that may account for significant variability in reported findings. We searched {PubMed} and {ISI} Web of Knowledge databases for articles published from 1985 to 2008 that used the wildcard terms “Depress*” and “Amygdal*” in the title, keywords, or abstract. From the 13 studies that met inclusion criteria for our meta-analysis, we calculated aggregate effect size and heterogeneity estimates from amygdala volumetric data; we then used meta-regression to determine whether variability in specific extraexperimental factors accounted for variability in findings. The lack of a reliable difference in amygdala volume between depressed and never-depressed individuals was accounted for by a positive correlation between amygdala volume differences and the proportion of medicated depressed persons in study samples: whereas the aggregate effect size calculated from studies that included only medicated individuals indicated that amygdala volume was significantly increased in depressed relative to healthy persons, studies with only unmedicated depressed individuals showed a reliable decrease in amygdala volume in depression. These findings are consistent with a formulation in which an antidepressant-mediated increase in levels of brain derived neurotrophic factor promotes neurogenesis and protects against glucocorticoid toxicity in the amygdala in medicated but not in unmedicated depression.},

	abstract = {An adaptive response to threat requires optimized detection of critical sensory cues. This optimization is thought to be aided by freezing - an evolutionarily preserved defensive state of immobility characterized by parasympathetically mediated fear bradycardia and regulated by the amygdala-periaqueductal grey ({PAG}) circuit. Behavioral observations in humans and animals have suggested that freezing is also a state of enhanced visual sensitivity, particularly for coarse visual information, but the underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. We induced a freezing-like state in healthy volunteers using threat of electrical shock and measured threat-related changes in both stimulus-independent (baseline) and stimulus-evoked visuocortical activity to low-vs. highspatial frequency gratings, using functional {MRI}. As measuring immobility is not feasible in {MRI} environments, we used fear bradycardia and amygdala-{PAG} coupling in inferring a freezing-like state. An independent functional localizer and retinotopic mapping were used to assess the retinotopic specificity of visuocortical modulations. We found a threat-induced increase in baseline (stimulus-independent) visuocortical activity that was retinotopically nonspecific, which was accompanied by increased connectivity with the amygdala. A positive correlation between visuocortical activity and fear bradycardia (while controlling for sympathetic activation), and a concomitant increase in amygdala-{PAG} connectivity, confirmed the specificity of these findings for the parasympathetically dominated freezing-like state. Visuocortical responses to gratings were retinotopically specific, but did not differ between threat and safe conditions across participants. However, individuals who exhibited better discrimination of low-spatial frequency stimuli showed reduced stimulus-evoked V1 responses under threat. Our findings suggest that a defensive state of freezing involves an integration of preparatory defensive and perceptual changes which may be regulated by a common mechanism involving the amygdala.},

	abstract = {Relative to neutral memories, negative and positive memories both exhibit an increase in memory longevity, subjective memory re-experiencing, and amygdala activation. These memory enhancements are often attributed to shared influences of arousal on memory. Yet prior work suggests the intriguing possibility that arousal affects memory networks in valence-specific ways. Psychophysics work has shown that arousal-related heart rate deceleration ({HRD}) responses are related to enhanced amygdala-visual functional connectivity ({AVFC}) and visual perception of negative stimuli. However, in the memory realm, it is not known if the effect of {AVFC} influences subsequent negative memory outcomes as a function of the magnitude of physiological arousal during encoding. Using psycho-autonomic interaction ({PAI}) analyses and trial-level measures of heart rate deceleration ({HRD}) as an objective measure of arousal during encoding of emotional stimuli, our findings suggest the magnitude of the {HRD} modulates the effect of {AVFC} on subsequent negative memory vividness. Specifically, {AVFC} effects in early visual regions predicted negative memory vividness, not neutral or positive vividness, but only in the presence of heightened physiological arousal. This novel approach was grounded in a replication of prior working showing enhanced {HRD} effects in the insula for negative stimuli. These findings demonstrate that the effect of arousal on emotional memory networks depends on valence and provide further evidence that negative valence may enhance the incorporation of visuo-sensory regions into emotional memory networks.},

Several sophisticated software packages (e.g., {AFNI}, {BrainVoyager}, {FSL}, {FreeSurfer}, Nipy, R, {SPM}) are used to process and analyze large and often diverse (highly multi-dimensional) data. However, this heterogeneous collection of specialized applications creates several issues that hinder replicable, efficient, and optimal use of neuroimaging analysis approaches: (1) No uniform access to neuroimaging analysis software and usage information; (2) No framework for comparative algorithm development and dissemination; (3) Personnel turnover in laboratories often limits methodological continuity and training new personnel takes time; (4) Neuroimaging software packages do not address computational efficiency; and (5) Methods sections in journal articles are inadequate for reproducing results. To address these issues, we present Nipype (Neuroimaging in Python: Pipelines and Interfaces; http://nipy.org/nipype), an open-source, community-developed, software package, and scriptable library. Nipype solves the issues by providing Interfaces to existing neuroimaging software with uniform usage semantics and by facilitating interaction between these packages using Workflows. Nipype provides an environment that encourages interactive exploration of algorithms, eases the design of Workflows within and between packages, allows rapid comparative development of algorithms and reduces the learning curve necessary to use different packages. Nipype supports both local and remote execution on multi-core machines and clusters, without additional scripting. Nipype is Berkeley Software Distribution licensed, allowing anyone unrestricted usage. An open, community-driven development philosophy allows the software to quickly adapt and address the varied needs of the evolving neuroimaging community, especially in the context of increasing demand for reproducible research.},

	abstract = {Here, we demonstrate that subject motion produces substantial changes in the timecourses of resting state functional connectivity {MRI} (rs-{fcMRI}) data despite compensatory spatial registration and regression of motion estimates from the data. These changes cause systematic but spurious correlation structures throughout the brain. Speciﬁcally, many long-distance correlations are decreased by subject motion, whereas many short-distance correlations are increased. These changes in rs-{fcMRI} correlations do not arise from, nor are they adequately countered by, some common functional connectivity processing steps. Two indices of data quality are proposed, and a simple method to reduce motion-related effects in rs-{fcMRI} analyses is demonstrated that should be ﬂexibly implementable across a variety of software platforms. We demonstrate how application of this technique impacts our own data, modifying previous conclusions about brain development. These results suggest the need for greater care in dealing with subject motion, and the need to critically revisit previous rs-{fcMRI} work that may not have adequately controlled for effects of transient subject movements.},

Now it is known to play a more comprehensive role in the processing of sensory information, including acting as primary cortex for interoceptive information, including autonomic nervous system mediated changes. As such, it is critical for emotional feeling in accord with the James-Lange theory, a role previously ascribed to the limbic system. Neuroimaged abnormal grey matter volumes or activity levels in the insula have been associated with schizophrenia, eating disorders, anxiety and mood disorders, conduct disorder, autism, addiction, and chronic pain. The significance of these abnormal activity patterns remains theoretical. Neuropsychological studies have linked dominant insula injury with various symptoms of aphasia, but its exact role in language processing remains uncertain as most cases involve lesions that extend into perisylvian language zones. Functional neuroimaging studies have found insula hyper-activations, typically in conjunction with anterior cingulate cortex, for all manner of experimental tasks including those involving perception, intentional action, and consciousness. Such neuroimaged activity is unlikely to be taskspecific, but rather reflective of generic changes in autonomic activity in response to salience, homeostatic incongruence, or cognitive challenge.},

Circadian rhythms are predictable fluctuations of energetic activation produced by an internal pacemaker, the circadian clock, that governs the daily functioning of the human body and mind. Chronotypes are individual differences in the setting of this biological clock that influence preferences for the optimal timing of daily periods of activity and rest. In this paper, we review the chronobiology literature as it applies to leadership research to advance a circadian leadership perspective that integrates circadian science with leadership science. We outline how a circadian perspective can help researchers to understand how time of day interacts with circadian processes to influence the effectiveness of task-, relational-, and change-oriented leadership activities. Our circadian perspective also extends research on leader and follower individual differences by explaining the effects of chronotypes on leadership behaviors and outcomes. We develop propositions based on the most promising insights that have emerged from the literature review, advance ideas for future theory development and research, and discuss implications for leaders in practice.},

Much of the research on circadian arousal and cognition has examined the consequence of testing individuals at times that are synchronous or asynchronous with their personal circadian peaks. To date, the studies examining these synchrony effects in cognitive function have focused primarily on the performance of individuals who show strong morningness or strong eveningness tendencies; little is known about individuals with neutral chronotypes and whether their performance varies over the day. The lack of data on neutral types is a serious gap in our knowledge, as up to 60\% of young adults and 25\% of older adults do not show strong morning or evening preferences. The present study assessed the performance of neutral-type younger and older adults at three times of day (early morning, midday, and evening) on a battery of cognitive tasks, including inhibitory processing, executive function, memory, perceptual speed, and access to well-learned knowledge. Older neutral-types showed synchrony effects for inhibitory processing, executive function, long-term memory, and forgetting, and generally had best performance on these tasks at midday. Consistent with other findings, older neutral-types showed no synchrony effects for measures of general knowledge and perceptual speed. Younger neutral-types, by contrast, showed no effects of time of testing on performance over the day for any measure, suggesting greater cognitive flexibility over the day relative to younger evening-types, older morning-types, or older neutral-types.},

	abstract = {Extracting shared structure across our experiences allows us to generalize our knowledge to novel contexts. How do different brain states influence this ability to generalize? Using a novel category learning paradigm, we assess the effect of both sleep and time of day on generalization that depends on the flexible integration of recent information. Counter to our expectations, we found no evidence that this form of generalization is better after a night of sleep relative to a day awake. Instead, we observed an effect of time of day, with better generalization in the morning than the evening. This effect also manifested as increased false memory for generalized information. In a nap experiment, we found that generalization did not benefit from having slept recently, suggesting a role for time of day apart from sleep. In follow-up experiments, we were unable to replicate the time of day effect for reasons that may relate to changes in category structure and task engagement. Despite this lack of consistency, we found a morning benefit for generalization when analyzing all the data from experiments with matched protocols (n = 136). We suggest that a state of lowered inhibition in the morning may facilitate spreading activation between otherwise separate memories, promoting this form of generalization.},

	abstract = {Recently, compelling evidence has accumulated that links sleep to learning and memory. Sleep has been identified as a state that optimizes the consolidation of newly acquired information in memory. Consolidation is an active process that is presumed to rely on the covert reactivation and reorganization of newly encoded representations. Hippocampus-dependent memories benefit primarily from slow-wave sleep ({SWS}), whereas memories not depending on the hippocampus show greater gains over periods containing high amounts of rapid eye movement sleep. One way sleep does this is by establishing different patterns of neurotransmitters and neurohormone secretion between sleep stages. Another central role for consolidating memories is played by the slow oscillation, that is, the oscillating field potential change dominating {SWS}. The emergence of slow oscillations in neocortical networks depends on the prior use of these networks for encoding of information. Via efferent pathways, they synchronize the occurrence of sharp wave ripples accompanying memory reactivations in the hippocampus with thalamocortical spindle activity. Thus, hippocampal memories are fed back into neocortical networks at a time when these networks are depolarized and, because of concurrent spindle activity, can most sensitively react to these inputs with plastic changes underlying the formation of long-term memory representations.},

            Memory consolidation involves the reactivation of memory traces during sleep. If different memories are reactivated each night, how much do they interfere with one another? We examined whether reactivating multiple memories incurs a cost to sleep-related benefits by contrasting reactivation of multiple memories versus single memories during sleep. First, participants learned the on-screen location of different objects. Each object was part of a semantically coherent group comprised of either one, two, or six items (e.g., six different cats). During sleep, sounds were unobtrusively presented to reactivate memories for half of the groups (e.g., “meow”). Memory benefits for cued versus non-cued items were independent of the number of items in the group, suggesting that reactivation occurs in a simultaneous and promiscuous manner. Intriguingly, sleep spindles and delta-theta power modulations were sensitive to group size, reflecting the extent of previous learning. Our results demonstrate that multiple memories may be consolidated in parallel without compromising each memory’s sleep-related benefit. These findings highlight alternative models for parallel consolidation that should be considered in future studies.},

	abstract = {Sleep supports memory consolidation. However, it is not completely clear how different sleep stages contribute to this process. While rapid eye movement sleep ({REM}) has been traditionally implicated in the processing of emotionally charged material, recent studies indicate a role for slow wave sleep ({SWS}) in strengthening the memories of emotional stimuli. Here, to directly examine which sleep stage is primarily involved in emotional memory consolidation, we used targeted memory reactivation ({TMR}) in {REM} and {SWS} during a daytime nap. We also examined neural oscillations associated with {TMR}-related changes in memory. Contrary to our hypothesis, reactivation of emotional stimuli during {REM} led to impaired memory. Meanwhile, reactivation of emotional stimuli in {SWS} improved memory and was strongly correlated with the product of times spent in {REM} and {SWS} (\%{SWS} × \%{REM}). When this variable was taken into account, reactivation significantly enhanced memory, with larger reactivation benefits compared to reactivation in {REM}. Notably, sleep spindle activity was modulated by emotional valence, and delta/theta activity was correlated with the memory benefit for both emotional and neutral items. Finally, we found no evidence that emotional memories benefited from {TMR} more than did neutral ones. Our results provide direct evidence for a complementary role of both {REM} and {SWS} in emotional memory consolidation, and suggest that {REM} may separately facilitate forgetting. In addition, our findings expand upon recent evidence indicating a link between sleep spindles and emotional processing.},

	abstract = {The human ability to make tools and use them to solve problems may not be zoologically unique, but it is certainly extraordinary. Yet little is known about the conceptual machinery that makes humans so competent at making and using tools. Do adults and children have concepts specialized for understanding human-made artifacts? If so, are these concepts deployed in attempts to solve novel problems? Here we present new data, derived from problem-solving experiments, which support the following. (i) The structure of the child's concept of artifact function changes profoundly between ages 5 and 7. At age 5, the child's conceptual machinery defines the function of an artifact as any goal a user might have; by age 7, its function is defined by the artifact's typical or intended use. (ii) This conceptual shift has a striking effect on problem-solving performance, i.e. the child's concept of artifact function appears to be deployed in problem solving. (iii) This effect on problem solving is not caused by differences in the amount of knowledge that children have about the typical use of a particular tool; it is mediated by the structure of the child's artifact concept (which organizes and deploys the child's knowledge). In two studies, children between 5 and 7 years of age were matched for their knowledge of what a particular artifact “is for”, and then given a problem that can only be solved if that tool is used for an atypical purpose. All children performed well in a baseline condition. But when they were primed by a demonstration of the artifact's typical function, 5-year-old children solved the problem much faster than 6–7-year-old children. Because all children knew what the tools were for, differences in knowledge alone cannot explain the results. We argue that the older children were slower to solve the problem when the typical function was primed because (i) their artifact concept plays a role in problem solving, and (ii) intended purpose is central to their concept of artifact function, but not to that of the younger children.},

As such, functional fixedness disturbs the use of tools during mechanical problem solving. Little is known about whether this bias emerges from different experiences with tools, whether it occurs regardless of problem difficulty, or whether there are protective factors against it. To resolve the first issue, we created five experimental groups: Reading (R), Video (V), Manual (M), No Functional Fixedness ({NFF}), and No Training ({NT}). The R group learned to use tools by reading a description of their use, the V group by watching an instructional video, and the M group through direct instruction and active manipulation of the tools. To resolve the remaining two issues, we created mechanical puzzles of distinct difficulty and used tests of intuitive physics, fine motor skills, and creativity. Results showed that misleading functional knowledge is at the core of functional fixedness, and that this bias generates cognitive impasses in simple puzzles, but it does not play a role in higher difficulty problems. Additionally, intuitive physics and motor skills were protective factors against its emergence, but creativity did not influence it. Although functional fixedness leads to inaccurate problem solving, our results suggest that its effects are more limited than previously assumed.},

Such rapid, ongoing changes may be followed by the establishment of new connections through dendritic growth and arborization. However, they harbor the danger that the evolving pattern of neural activation may in itself lead to abnormal behavior. Plasticity is the mechanism for development and learning, as much as a cause of pathology. The challenge we face is to learn enough about the mechanisms of plasticity to modulate them to achieve the best behavioral outcome for a given subject.},

In Experiment 2, thirty-five 18–35-year-olds used a wearable device to monitor sleep with and without the mask.

Speciﬁcally, several neuron types (e.g., stellate, basket, Lugaro, Golgi, and granule neurons; N = 317) of the cerebellar cortex were stained with a modiﬁed rapid Golgi technique and quantiﬁed on a computer-assisted microscopy system. There was a 64-fold variation in brain mass across species in our sample (from clouded leopard to the elephant) and a 103-fold variation in cerebellar volume. Most dendritic measures tended to increase with cerebellar volume. The cerebellar cortex in these species exhibited the trilaminate pattern common to all mammals. Morphologically, neuron types in the cerebellar cortex were generally consistent with those described in primates (Fox et al., 1967) and rodents (Palay and Chan-Palay, 1974), although there was substantial quantitative variation across species. In particular, Lugaro neurons in the elephant appeared to be disproportionately larger than those in other species. To explore potential quantitative differences in dendritic measures across species, {MARSplines} analyses were used to evaluate whether species could be differentiated from each other based on dendritic characteristics alone. Results of these analyses indicated that there were signiﬁcant differences among all species in dendritic measures.},

It has tripled in size from Australopithecines to modern humans1 and has become almost six times larger than expected for a placental mammal of human size2. Brains incur high metabolic costs3 and accordingly a long-standing question is why the large human brain has evolved4. The leading hypotheses propose benefits of improved cognition for overcoming ecological5–7, social8–10 or cultural11–14 challenges. However, these hypotheses are typically assessed using correlative analyses, and establishing causes for brain-size evolution remains difficult15,16. Here we introduce a metabolic approach that enables causal assessment of social hypotheses for brain-size evolution. Our approach yields quantitative predictions for brain and body size from formalized social hypotheses given empirical estimates of the metabolic costs of the brain. Our model predicts the evolution of adult Homo sapiens-sized brains and bodies when individuals face a combination of 60\% ecological, 30\% cooperative and 10\% between-group competitive challenges, and suggests that between-individual competition has been unimportant for driving human brain-size evolution. Moreover, our model indicates that brain expansion in Homo was driven by ecological rather than social challenges, and was perhaps strongly promoted by culture. Our metabolic approach thus enables causal assessments that refine, refute and unify hypotheses of brain-size evolution.},

	abstract = {Signs of mental ill health that cut across psychiatric diagnostic categories at high rates are typically viewed as non-specific occurrences, downgraded in importance and disregarded. However, problems not associated with particular diagnoses should be expected if there is shared causation across mental health conditions. If dynamic networks of interacting symptoms are the reality of mental health presentations, then particularly disruptive and highly connected problems should be especially common. The non-specific occurrence might be highly consequential. One non-specific occurrence that is often overlooked is patients' chronic difficulty in getting good sleep. In this Review, we consider whether disrupted sleep might be a contributory causal factor in the occurrence of major types of mental health disorders. It is argued that insomnia and other mental health conditions not only share common causes but also show a bidirectional relationship, with typically the strongest pathway being disrupted sleep as a causal factor in the occurrence of other psychiatric problems. Treating insomnia lessens other mental health problems. Intervening on sleep at an early stage might be a preventive strategy for the onset of clinical disorders. Our recommendations are that insomnia is assessed routinely in the occurrence of mental health disorders; that sleep disturbance is treated in services as a problem in its own right, yet also recognised as a pathway to reduce other mental health difficulties; and that access to evidence-based treatment for sleep difficulties is expanded in mental health services.},

	abstract = {Study Objectives:
To assess the prevalence of sleep problems and their association with psychotic symptoms using a global database.

Design:
Community-based cross-sectional study.

Setting:
Data were analyzed from the World Health Organization's World Health Survey ({WHS}), a population-based survey conducted in 70 countries between 2002 and 2004.

Patients or Participants:
261,547 individuals aged ≥ 18 years from 56 countries.

Interventions:
N/A.

Measurements and Results:
The presence of psychotic symptoms in the past 12 months was established using 4 questions pertaining to positive symptoms from the psychosis screening module of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Sleep problems referred to severe or extreme sleep problems in the past 30 days. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the associations. The overall prevalence of sleep problems was 7.6\% and ranged from 1.6\% (China) to 18.6\% (Morocco). Sleep problems were associated with significantly higher odds for at least one psychotic symptom in the vast majority of countries. In the pooled sample, after adjusting for demographic factors, alcohol consumption, smoking, and chronic medical conditions, having sleep problems resulted in an odds ratio ({OR}) for at least one psychotic symptom of 2.41 (95\% confidence interval [{CI}] 2.18–2.65). This {OR} was 1.59 (1.40–1.81) when further adjusted for anxiety and depression.

Conclusions:
A strong association between sleep problems and psychotic symptoms was observed globally. These results have clinical implications and serve as a basis for future studies to elucidate the causal association between psychotic symptoms and sleep problems.

	abstract = {Climate change is with us. As professionals who place value on evidence-based practice, climate change is something we cannot ignore. The current pandemic of the novel coronavirus, {SARS}-{CoV}-2, has demonstrated how global crises can arise suddenly and have a signiﬁcant impact on public health. Global warming, a chronic process punctuated by acute episodes of extreme weather events, is an insidious global health crisis needing at least as much attention. Many neurological diseases are complex chronic conditions inﬂuenced at many levels by changes in the environment. This review aimed to collate and evaluate reports from clinical and basic science about the relationship between climate change and epilepsy. The keywords climate change, seasonal variation, temperature, humidity, thermoregulation, biorhythm, gene, circadian rhythm, heat, and weather were used to search the published evidence. A number of climatic variables are associated with increased seizure frequency in people with epilepsy. Climate changeinduced increase in seizure precipitants such as fevers, stress, and sleep deprivation (e.g. as a result of more frequent extreme weather events) or vector-borne infections may trigger or exacerbate seizures, lead to deterioration of seizure control, and affect neurological, cerebrovascular, or cardiovascular comorbidities and risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy. Risks are likely to be modiﬁed by many factors, ranging from individual genetic variation and temperature-dependent channel function, to housing quality and global supply chains. According to the results of the limited number of experimental studies with animal models of seizures or epilepsy, different seizure types appear to have distinct susceptibility to seasonal inﬂuences. Increased body temperature, whether in the context of fever or not, has a critical role in seizure threshold and seizure-related brain damage. Links between climate change and epilepsy are likely to be multifactorial, complex, and often indirect, which makes predictions difﬁcult. We need more data on possible climate-driven altered risks for seizures, epilepsy, and epileptogenesis, to identify underlying mechanisms at systems, cellular, and molecular levels for better understanding of the impact of climate change on epilepsy. Further focussed data would help us to develop evidence for mitigation methods to do more to protect people with epilepsy from the effects of climate change.},

	abstract = {Several aspects of thermoregulation play a role in epilepsy. Circuitries involved in thermoregulation are affected by seizures and epilepsy, hyperthermia may be both cause and result of seizures, and hypothermia may prevent or abort seizures. Autonomic manifestations of seizures including thermoregulatory disturbances are common in a variety of clinical epilepsy syndromes. Experimental hyperthermia has been studied extensively, predominantly to investigate febrile seizures of childhood. In particular prolonged or complex febrile seizures have been associated with the later development of epilepsy in adulthood and the pathophysiology of how febrile seizures cause epilepsy is of tremendous interest. Febrile seizures represent an opportunity to potentially intervene early in life in susceptible individuals and affect epileptogenesis. The pathophysiologic underpinnings of how hyperthermia induces seizures and how this in turn results in epilepsy are controversial, but likely involve multiple factors. Both glutamatergic and {GABAergic} neurotransmission is affected, and numerous mutations in genes encoding ion channels have been identified. Cytokines such as interleukin-1β have been implicated in febrile seizures as well as susceptibility to provoked seizures later in life. Hyperthermia is a common feature of generalized convulsive status epilepticus, but may also be seen with nonconvulsive seizures, indicating involvement of thermoregulatory centers.},

The gradual increase in ambient temperature, coupled with elevated pollution levels have a devastating effect on our health, potentially contributing to the increased rate and severity of numerous neurological disorders. The main aim of this review paper is to shed some light on the association between the phenomena of global warming and air pollution, and two of the most common and debilitating neurological conditions: stroke and neurodegenerative disorders. Extreme ambient temperatures induce neurological impairment and increase stroke incidence and mortality. Global warming does not participate in the etiology of neurodegenerative disorders, but it exacerbates symptoms of dementia, Alzheimer's disease ({AD}) and Parkinson's Disease ({PD}). A very close link exists between accumulated levels of air pollutants (principally particulate matter), and the incidence of ischemic rather than hemorrhagic strokes. People exposed to air pollutants have a higher risk of developing dementia and {AD}, but not {PD}. Oxidative stress, changes in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular haemodynamics, excitotoxicity, microglial activation, and cellular apoptosis, all play a central role in the overlap of the effect of climate change on neurological disorders. The complex interactions between global warming and air pollution, and their intricate effect on the nervous system, imply that future policies aimed to mitigate climate change must address these two challenges in unison.},

	abstract = {Objective Most epileptic seizures occur unexpectedly and independently of known risk factors. We aimed to evaluate the clinical significance of patients’ perception that weather is a risk factor for epileptic seizures. Methods Using a hospital-based, bidirectional case-crossover study, 604 adult patients admitted to a large university hospital in Central Germany for an unprovoked epileptic seizure between 2003 and 2010 were recruited. The effect of atmospheric pressure, relative air humidity, and ambient temperature on the onset of epileptic seizures under temperate climate conditions was estimated. Results We found a close-to-linear negative correlation between atmospheric pressure and seizure risk. For every 10.7 {hPa} lower atmospheric pressure, seizure risk increased in the entire study population by 14\% (odds ratio [{OR}] 1.14, 95\% confidence interval [{CI}] 1.01–1.28). In patients with less severe epilepsy treated with one antiepileptic medication, seizure risk increased by 36\% (1.36, 1.09–1.67). A high relative air humidity of {\textgreater}80\% increased seizure risk in the entire study population by up to 48\% ({OR} 1.48, 95\% {CI} 1.11–1.96) 3 days after exposure in a J-shaped association. High ambient temperatures of {\textgreater}20°C decreased seizure risk by 46\% in the overall study population ({OR} 0.54, 95\% {CI} 0.32–0.90) and in subgroups, with the greatest effects observed in male patients ({OR} 0.33, 95\% {CI} 0.14–0.74). Significance Low atmospheric pressure and high relative air humidity are associated with an increased risk for epileptic seizures, whereas high ambient temperatures seem to decrease seizure risk. Weather-dependent seizure risk may be accentuated in patients with less severe epilepsy. Our results require further replication across different climate regions and cohorts before reliable clinical recommendations can be made.},

Neurobiological systems mediate interactions between animals and their environments and evolved over millions of years to detect and respond to change. To gain an understanding of the adaptive capacity of nervous systems given an unprecedented pace of environmental change, mechanisms of physiology and behavior at the cellular and biophysical level must be examined. While behavioral changes resulting from anthropogenic activity are becoming increasingly described, identification and examination of the cellular, molecular, and circuit-level processes underlying those changes are profoundly underexplored. Hence, the field of neuroscience lacks predictive frameworks to describe which neurobiological systems may be resilient or vulnerable to rapidly changing ecosystems, or what modes of adaptation are represented in our natural world. In this review, we highlight examples of animal behavior modification and corresponding nervous system adaptation in response to rapid environmental change. The underlying cellular, molecular, and circuit-level component processes underlying these behaviors are not known and emphasize the unmet need for rigorous scientific enquiry into the neurobiology of changing ecosystems.},

Activation of fusiform gyri by faces was strongly affected by attentional condition, but the left amygdala response to fearful faces was not. Right fusiform activity was greater for fearful than neutral faces, independently of the attention effect on this region.

	abstract = {The present study examined whether automaticity, defined here as independence from attentional modulation, is a fundamental principle of the neural systems specialized for processing social signals of environmental threat. Attention was focused on either scenes or faces presented in a single overlapping display. Facial expressions were neutral, fearful, or disgusted. Amygdala responses to facial expressions of fear, a signifier of potential physical attack, were not reduced with reduced attention to faces. In contrast, anterior insular responses to facial expressions of disgust, a signifier of potential physical contamination, were reduced with reduced attention. However, reduced attention enhanced the amygdala response to disgust expressions; this enhanced amygdala response to disgust correlated with the magnitude of attentional reduction in the anterior insular response to disgust. These results suggest that automaticity is not fundamental to the processing of all facial signals of threat, but is unique to amygdala processing of fear. Furthermore, amygdala processing of fear was not entirely automatic, coming at the expense of specificity of response. Amygdala processing is thus specific to fear only during attended processing, when cortical processing is undiminished, and more broadly tuned to threat during unattended processing, when cortical processing is diminished.},

Pictures of human faces bearing fearful or happy expressions were presented to 10 normal, healthy subjects by using a backward masking procedure that resulted in 8 of 10 subjects reporting that they had not seen these facial expressions. The backward masking procedure consisted of 33 msec presentations of fearful or happy facial expressions, their offset coincident with the onset of 167 msec presentations of neutral facial expressions. Although subjects reported seeing only neutral faces, blood oxygen level-dependent ({BOLD}) {fMRI} signal in the amygdala was significantly higher during viewing of masked fearful faces than during the viewing of masked happy faces. This difference was composed of significant signal increases in the amygdala to masked fearful faces as well as significant signal decreases to masked happy faces, consistent with the notion that the level of amygdala activation is affected differentially by the emotional valence of external stimuli. In addition, these facial expressions activated the sublenticular substantia innominata ({SI}), where signal increases were observed to both fearful and happy faces—suggesting a spatial dissociation of territories that respond to emotional valence versus salience or arousal value. This study, using {fMRI} in conjunction with masked stimulus presentations, represents an initial step toward determining the role of the amygdala in nonconscious processing.},

	abstract = {Sleep after learning promotes the quantitative strengthening of new memories. Less is known about the impact of sleep on the qualitative reorganisation of memory, which is the focus of this review. Studies have shown that, in the declarative system, sleep facilitates the abstraction of rules (schema formation), the integration of knowledge into existing schemas (schema integration) and creativity that requires the disbandment of existing patterns (schema disintegration). Schema formation and integration might primarily beneﬁt from slow wave sleep, whereas the disintegration of a schema might be facilitated by rapid eye movement sleep. In the procedural system, sleep fosters the reorganisation of motor memory. The neural mechanisms of these processes remain to be determined. Notably, emotions have been shown to modulate the sleep-related reorganisation of memories. In the ﬁnal section of this review, we propose that the sleep-related reorganisation of memories might be particularly relevant for mental disorders. Thus, sleep disruptions might contribute to disturbed memory reorganisation and to the development of mental disorders. Therefore, sleep-related interventions might modulate the reorganisation of memories and provide new inroads into treatment.},

Other variables such as semantic relatedness also play a role in the enhanced memory for emotional stimuli, especially for verbal stimuli. Research has not addressed the contributions of emotional arousal, indexed by self-report and autonomic measures, and semantic relatedness on memory performance. Twenty young adults (10 women) were presented neutral-unrelated words, schoolrelated words, moderately arousing emotional words, and highly arousing taboo words while heart rate and skin conductance were measured. Memory was tested with free recall and recognition tests. Results showed that taboo words, which were both semantically related and high arousal were remembered best. School-related words, which were high on semantic relatedness but low on arousal, were remembered better than the moderately arousing emotional words and semantically unrelated neutral words. Psychophysiological responses showed that within the moderately arousing emotional and neutral word groups, those words eliciting greater autonomic activity were better remembered than words that did not elicit such activity. These results demonstrate additive effects of semantic relatedness and emotional arousal on memory. Relatedness confers an advantage to memory (as in the school-words), but the combination of relatedness and arousal (as in the taboo words) results in the best memory performance.},

	shorttitle = {Implicit and explicit emotional memory recall in anxiety and depression},
	abstract = {Anxiety and depression are linked to both explicit and implicit memory biases, which are defined as the tendency to preferentially recall emotionally negative information at conscious and subconscious levels, respectively. Functional connectivity ({FC}) of the basolateral amygdala ({BLA}) and related stress hormones (i.e., cortisol and norepinephrine) are purportedly implicated in these biases. However, previous findings on memory biases in anxiety and depression have been inconsistent, likely due to their symptomatic complications. Therefore, the underlying neurobiological mechanism remains unclear. We thus investigated whether anxiety and depression as premorbid predispositions are related to the memory biases, and whether {FC} of {BLA}, cortisol, and 3-methoxy-4hydroxyphenylglycol ({MHPG}: a major metabolite of norepinephrine) would affect the anxiety/depression-related biased memory recall in 100 participants without psychiatric symptomatology. Psycho-behavioral assessment, resting-state {fMRI} scans, and saliva collection at 10-points-in-time across two days were conducted. Correlations of memory biases with anxiety/depression and neurobiological markers were explored. As a result, neither anxiety nor depression were correlated with explicit memory bias to negative (vs. positive) information, although depression was associated with better recall of the negative stimuli only when they were perceived as selfrelevant. In contrast, both anxiety and depression were correlated with implicit memory bias; however, the effects were solely explained by anxiety. Furthermore, {FC} of the {BLA} with subgenual anterior cingulate cortex ({sgACC}) and the synergetic effect of cortisol and {MHPG} uniquely affected the implicit memory bias. These findings suggest that anxiety facilitates an initial snapshot of negative information and can be accompanied by depression when the information creates negative semantic associations with the self. The {BLA}-{sgACC} neural connectivity and cortisol-norepinephrine interaction that are associated with the implicit memory bias might be one of the important neurobiological targets in the prevention and treatment for comorbid anxiety and depressive disorders.},

In these regards, negative and positive memories can be especially powerful: Life’s highs and lows are disproportionately represented in memory, and when they are retrieved, they often impact our current mood and thoughts and influence various forms of behavior. Research rooted in neuroscience and cognitive psychology has historically focused on memory for negative emotional content. Yet the study of autobiographical memories has highlighted the importance of positive emotional memories, and more recently, cognitive neuroscience methods have begun to clarify why positive memories may show powerful relations to mental wellbeing. Here, we review the models that have been proposed to explain why emotional memories are long-lasting (durable) and likely to be retrieved (accessible), describing how in overlapping—but distinctly separable—ways, positive and negative memories can be easier to retrieve, and more likely to influence behavior. We end by identifying potential implications of this literature for broader topics related to mental wellbeing, education, and workplace environments.},

	abstract = {Sleep is known to support memory consolidation. Here we review evidence for an active system consolidation occurring during sleep. At the beginning of this process is sleep’s ability to preserve episodic experiences preferentially encoded in hippocampal networks. Repeated neuronal reactivation of these representations during slow-wave sleep transforms episodic representations into long-term memories, redistributes them toward extrahippocampal networks, and qualitatively changes them to decontextualized schema-like representations. Electroencephalographic ({EEG}) oscillations regulate the underlying communication: Hippocampal sharp-wave ripples coalescing with thalamic spindles mediate the bottom-up transfer of reactivated memory information to extrahippocampal regions. Neocortical slow oscillations exert a supraordinate top-down control to synchronize hippocampal reactivations of speciﬁc memories to their excitable up-phase, thus allowing plastic changes in extrahippocampal regions. We propose that reactivations during sleep are a general mechanism underlying the abstraction of temporally stable invariants from a ﬂow of input that is solely structured in time, thus representing a basic mechanism of memory formation.},

With one-third of patients not responding to standard exposure-based psychotherapy, new treatment strategies are needed. Sleep offers a unique time window to enhance therapeutic efficacy. Traumatic memories that are neutralized in therapy need to be stored back into memory (consolidated) during sleep to solidify the treatment effect. New basic research shows that memory consolidation can be enhanced by presenting sounds or scents that were linked to the memory at encoding, again during sleep. This procedure, termed targeted memory reactivation ({TMR}), has, despite its clinical potential, not been tested in ({PTSD}) pa­ tients. In this narrative review, we explore the potential of {TMR} as a new sleep-based treatment for {PTSD}. First we provide the necessary background on the memory and sleep principles underlying {PTSD} as well as the present applications and conditional factors of {TMR}.

An activation pattern common to both spindle types involved the thalami, paralimbic areas (anterior cingulate and insular cortices), and superior temporal gyri. No thalamic difference was detected in the direct comparison between slow and fast spindles although some thalamic areas were preferentially activated in relation to either spindle type. Beyond the common activation pattern, the increases in cortical activity differed significantly between the two spindle types. Slow spindles were associated with increased activity in the superior frontal gyrus. In contrast, fast spindles recruited a set of cortical regions involved in sensorimotor processing, as well as the mesial frontal cortex and hippocampus. The recruitment of partially segregated cortical networks for slow and fast spindles further supports the existence of two spindle types during human non-rapid eye movement sleep, with potentially different functional significance.},

Yet it remains contentious whether sleep affords opportunities to modify or update emotional memories, particularly when people would prefer to forget those memories. Here, we attempted to update memories during sleep, using spoken positive words paired with cues to recent memories of aversive events. Affective updating using positive words during human non-rapid eye movement ({NREM}) sleep, compared with using neutral words instead, reduced negative affective judgments in post-sleep tests, suggesting that the recalled events were perceived as less aversive. Electroencephalogram ({EEG}) analyses showed that positive words modulated theta and spindle/sigma activity; speciﬁcally, to the extent that theta power was larger for the positive words than for the memory cues that followed, participants judged the memory cues less negatively. Moreover, to the extent that sigma power was larger for the positive words than for the memory cues that followed, participants forgot more episodic details about aversive events. Notably, when the onset of individual positive words coincided with the upphase of slow oscillations (a state characterized by increased cortical excitability during {NREM} sleep), affective updating was more successful. In sum, we altered the affective content of memories via the strategic pairing of positive words and memory cues during sleep, linked with {EEG} theta power increases and the slow oscillation up-phase. These ﬁndings suggest novel possibilities for modifying unwanted memories during sleep, which would not require people to consciously confront memories that they prefer to avoid.},

As a critical step in this research program, this study showed that the generic-parts technique can help people unearth the types of obscure features that can be used to overcome functional fixedness, which is a classic inhibitor to problem solving. Subjects trained on this technique solved on average 67\% more problems than a control group did.

	abstract = {A meta-analytic review of empirical studies that have investigated incubation effects on problem solving is reported. Although some researchers have reported increased solution rates after an incubation period (i.e., a period of time in which a problem is set aside prior to further attempts to solve), others have failed to find effects. The analysis examined the contributions of moderators such as problem type, presence of solution-relevant or misleading cues, and lengths of preparation and incubation periods to incubation effect sizes. The authors identified a positive incubation effect, with divergent thinking tasks benefiting more than linguistic and visual insight tasks from incubation. Longer preparation periods gave a greater incubation effect, whereas filling an incubation period with high cognitive demand tasks gave a smaller incubation effect. Surprisingly, low cognitive demand tasks yielded a stronger incubation effect than did rest during an incubation period when solving linguistic insight problems. The existence of multiple types of incubation effect provides evidence for differential invocation of knowledge-based vs. strategic solution processes across different classes of problem, and it suggests that the conditions under which incubation can be used as a practical technique for enhancing problem solving must be designed with care.},

            Although we experience thousands of distinct events on a daily basis, relatively few are committed to memory. The human capacity to intentionally control which events will be remembered has been demonstrated using learning procedures with instructions to purposely avoid committing specific items to memory. In this study, we used a variant of the item-based directed-forgetting procedure and instructed participants to memorize the location of some images but not others on a grid. These instructions were conveyed using a set of auditory cues. Then, during an afternoon nap, we unobtrusively presented a cue that was used to instruct participant to avoid committing the locations of some images to memory. After sleep, memory was worse for to-be-forgotten image locations associated with the presented sound relative to those associated with a sound that was not presented during sleep. We conclude that memory processing during sleep can serve not only to secure memory storage but also to weaken it. Given that intentional suppression may be used to weaken unpleasant memories, such sleep-based strategies may help accelerate treatments for memory-related disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder.},

	abstract = {A widely accepted view in memory research is that previously acquired information can be reactivated during sleep, leading to persistent memory storage. Targeted memory reactivation ({TMR}) was developed as a technique whereby specific memories can be reactivated during sleep using a sensory stimulus linked to prior learning. As a research tool, {TMR} can improve memory, raising the possibility that it may be useful for cognitive enhancement and clinical therapy. A major challenge for the expanded use of {TMR} is that a skilled operator must manually control stimulation, which is impractical in many settings. To address this limitation, we developed the {SleepStim} system for automated {TMR} in the home. {SleepStim} includes a smartwatch to collect movement and heart-rate data, plus a smartphone to emit auditory cues. A machine-learning model identifies periods of deep sleep and triggers {TMR} sounds within these periods. We tested whether this system could replicate the spatial-memory benefit of in-laboratory {TMR}. Participants learned locations of objects on a grid, and then half of the object locations were reactivated during sleep over 3 nights. Recall was tested each morning. In an experiment with 61 participants, the {TMR} effect was not significant but varied systematically with stimulus intensity; low-intensity but not high-intensity stimuli produced memory benefits. In a second experiment with 24 participants, we limited stimulus intensity and found that {TMR} reliably improved spatial memory, consistent with effects observed in laboratory studies. We conclude that {SleepStim} can effectively accomplish automated {TMR}, and that avoiding sleep disruption is critical for {TMR} benefits.},

We put forward the hypothesis that sleep organization, i.e. the regular occurrence of {NREM} – {REM} cycles, more than sleep states per se, may be crucial for the retention of verbal material presented before sleep. An experiment was performed in which recall of verbal material was requested of young subjects after three different kinds of night sleep: undisturbed sleep, fragmented sleep without sleep cycles disorganization, and fragmented sleep interrupted with sleep disorganization. Morning recall of verbal material was impaired after the night with disturbed sleep cycles, whereas it was not after the night with preserved sleep cycles; the amount of {REM} was similar in both cases. We conclude that the recall of verbal material is greatly affected by sleep cycle disorganization. © 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In addition to modulatory roles concerning bodily functions, sleep is assumed to play a main processing role with regard to newly acquired neural information. Elaboration of memory traces acquired during the waking period is assumed to require two sequential steps taking place during slow wave sleep ({SWS}) and eventually during paradoxical sleep ({PS}). This view is suggested by several considerations, not the least of which concerns the natural sequence of appearance of {SWS} and {PS} in the adult animal. While the involvement of {PS} in memory processing is well documented, the involvement of {SWS} is supported by the results of baseline and post-trial {EEG} analyses carried out in rats trained for a two-way active avoidance task or a spatial habituation task. Together with control analyses, these data indicate that the marked increase in the average duration of post-trial {SWS} episodes does not reflect the outcome of non-specific contingent factors, such as sleep loss or stress, but is related to memory processing events. Several considerations have furthermore led to the proposal that, during {SWS}, after a preliminary selection step, the first processing operation consists in the weakening of non-adaptative memory traces. The remaining memory traces would then be stored again under a better configuration during the ensuing {PS} episode. This view is in agreement with several relevant features of sleep, including the {EEG} waveforms prevailing during {SWS} and {PS}, as well as the ontogenetic sequence of appearance of {SWS} and {PS}. Some theoretical considerations on the role of sleep are also in agreement with the sequential hypothesis. More recent data indicate that the learning capacity of rats is correlated with several baseline {EEG} features of sleep and wakefulness. They include the average duration of {PS} episodes and of {SWS} episodes followed by wakefulness (longer in fast learning rats), and the waking {EEG} power spectrum of fast learning rats whose output is more balanced in the frequency range below 10 Hz than in slow learning and in non-learning rats. Additional {EEG} data suggest that fast learning rats may accomplish 'on line' processing of newly acquired information according to a sequence of events not dissimilar from the one proposed by the sequential hypotesis.},

	abstract = {There is now ample evidence that sleep spindles play a critical role in the consolidation of newly acquired motor sequences. Previous studies have also revealed that the interplay between different types of sleep oscillations (e.g. spindles, slow waves, sharpwave ripples) promotes the consolidation process of declarative memories. Yet the functional contribution of this type of frequencyspecific interactions to motor memory consolidation remains unknown. Thus, this study sought to investigate whether spindle oscillations are associated with low- or high-frequency activity at the regional (local) and interregional (connectivity) levels. Using an olfactory-targeted memory reactivation paradigm paired to a motor sequence learning task, we compared the effect of cuing (Cond) to no-cuing ({NoCond}) on frequency interactions during sleep spindles. Time–frequency decomposition analyses revealed that cuing induced significant differential and localized changes in delta (1–4 Hz) and theta (4–8 Hz) frequencies before, during, and after spindles, as well as changes in high-beta (20–30 Hz) during the spindle oscillation. Finally, coherence analyses yielded significant increases in connectivity during sleep spindles in both theta and sigma (11–17 Hz) bands in the cued group only. These results support the notion that the synchrony between spindle and associated low- or high-frequency rhythmic activity is an integral part of the memory reactivation process. Furthermore, they highlight the importance of not only measuring spindles’ characteristics, but to investigate such oscillations in both time and frequency domains when assessing memory consolidation-related changes.},

The sleep spindle is an event in the electroencephalogram ({EEG}) characterizing Stage 2 sleep. Sleep spindles may reﬂect, at the electrophysiological level, an ideal mechanism for inducing long-term synaptic changes in the neocortex. Recent evidence suggests the spindle is highly correlated with tests of intellectual ability (e.g.; {IQ} tests) and may serve as a physiological index of intelligence. Further, spindles increase in number and duration in sleep following new learning and are correlated with performance improvements. Spindle density and sigma (14–16 Hz) spectral power have been found to be positively correlated with performance following a daytime nap, and animal studies suggest the spindle is involved in a hippocampal–neocortical dialogue necessary for memory consolidation.

	abstract = {Sleep plays a role in memory consolidation. This is demonstrated by improved performance and neural plasticity underlying that improvement after sleep. Targeted memory reactivation ({TMR}) allows the manipulation of sleep-dependent consolidation through intentionally biasing the replay of specific memories in sleep, but the underlying neural basis of these altered memories remains unclear. We use functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) to show a change in the neural representation of a motor memory after targeted reactivation in slow-wave sleep ({SWS}). Participants learned two serial reaction time task ({SRTT}) sequences associated with different auditory tones (high or low pitch). During subsequent {SWS}, one sequence was reactivated by replaying the associated tones. Participants were retested on both sequences the following day during {fMRI}. As predicted, they showed faster reaction times for the cued sequence after targeted memory reactivation. Furthermore, increased activity in bilateral caudate nucleus and hippocampus for the cued relative to uncued sequence was associated with time in {SWS}, while increased cerebellar and cortical motor activity was related to time in rapid eye movement ({REM}) sleep. Functional connectivity between the caudate nucleus and hippocampus was also increased after targeted memory reactivation. These findings suggest that the offline performance gains associated with memory reactivation are supported by altered functional activity in key cognitive and motor networks, and that this consolidation is differentially mediated by both {REM} sleep and {SWS}.},

	abstract = {Methods:  In Experiment 1, participants associated words with verbal and nonverbal auditory stimuli before an overnight interval in which subsets of these stimuli were replayed in slow-wave sleep. We repeated this paradigm in Experiment 2 with the single difference that the gender of the verbal auditory stimuli was switched between learning and sleep.
Results:  In Experiment 1, forgetting of cued (vs. noncued) associations was reduced by {TMR} with verbal and nonverbal cues to similar extents. In Experiment 2, {TMR} with identical nonverbal cues reduced forgetting of cued (vs. noncued) associations, replicating Experiment 1. However, {TMR} with nonidentical verbal cues reduced forgetting of both cued and noncued associations.
Conclusions:  These experiments suggest that the memory effects of {TMR} are influenced by the acoustic overlap between stimuli delivered at training and sleep. Our findings hint at the existence of two processing routes for memory retrieval during sleep. Whereas {TMR} with acoustically identical cues may reactivate individual associations via simple episodic matching, {TMR} with nonidentical verbal cues may utilize linguistic decoding mechanisms, resulting in widespread reactivation across a broad category of memories.},

Memory reactivations can also be externally triggered during sleep by associated cues which enhance the sleep-dependent memory consolidation process. Here, we compared in humans the inﬂuence of sleep periods (i) of 40 min and (ii) of 90 min without externally triggered reactivations and (iii) of externally triggered reactivations by an associated odor cue during a 40-min sleep period on the consolidation of previously learned hippocampus-dependent visuo-spatial memories. We show that external reactivation by an odor cue during the 40-min sleep period enhanced memory stability to the same extent as 90 min of sleep without odor reactivation. In contrast, 40 min of sleep without external reactivations were not sufﬁcient to beneﬁt memory. In the 90-min sleep condition, memory enhancements were associated with time spent in {SWS} and were independent of the presence or absence of {REM} sleep. These results suggest that the efﬁcacy of hippocampus-dependent memory consolidation depends on the duration of sleep and particularly {SWS}.

	abstract = {Post-traumatic stress disorder ({PTSD}) is a trauma-related condition that produces distressing fear memory in­ trusions, avoidance behaviors, hyperarousal/startle, stress responses and insomnia. This review focuses on the importance of the orexin neural system as a novel mechanism related to the pathophysiology of {PTSD}. Orex­ inergic neurons originate in the lateral hypothalamus and project widely to key neurotransmitter systems, autonomic neurons, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ({HPA}) axis, and fear-related neural circuits. After trauma or stress, the basolateral amygdala ({BLA}) transmits sensory information to the central nucleus of the amygdala ({CeA}) and in turn to the hypothalamus and other subcortical and brainstem regions to promote fear and threat behaviors. Orexin receptors have a prominent role in this circuit as fear conditioned orexin receptor knockout mice show decreased fear expression while dual orexin receptor antagonists ({DORAs}) inhibit fear acquisition and expression. Orexin activation of an infralimbic-amygdala circuit impedes fear extinction while {DORA} treatments enhance it. Increased orexin signaling to the amygdalo-cortical-hippocampal circuit promotes avoidance be­ haviors. Orexin has an important role in activating sympathetic nervous system ({SNS}) activity and {HPA} axis stress responses. Blockade of orexin receptors reduces fear-conditioned startle responses. In {PTSD} models, in­ dividuals demonstrate sleep disturbances such as increased sleep latency and more transitions to wakefulness. Increased orexin activity impairs sleep by promoting wakefulness and reducing total sleep time while {DORA} treatments enhance sleep onset and maintenance. The orexinergic neural system provides important mechanisms for understanding multiple {PTSD} behaviors and provides new medication targets to treat this often persistent and debilitating illness.},

Healthy young adult volunteers viewed repeated presentations of highly negative and emotionally neutral (but equally arousing) International Affective Picture System ({IAPS}) photographs during two afternoon sessions separated by 2.5 hrs. Half of the photographs were shown at both sessions (Repeated Sets) and half differed between sessions (Novel Sets). For each stimulus presentation, evoked skin conductance response ({SCR}), heart rate deceleration ({HRD}) and corrugator supercilii {EMG} response ({EMG}), were computed and range corrected using respective maximum session-1 responses. Following each presentation, subjects rated each photograph on dimensions of pleasantness and arousability. During the inter-session interval, Nap subjects had a 120-min polysomnographically monitored sleep opportunity, whereas Wake subjects watched a non-stimulating video. Nap and Wake subjects did not differ in their subjective ratings of photographs. However, for Repeated-Set photographs, Nap subjects demonstrated greater inter-session habituation in {SCR} and {EMG} but a trend toward lesser inter-session habituation in {HRD}. These group differences were absent for Novel-Set photographs. Group differences across all measures were greater for negative stimuli. Occurrence of {SWS} during the nap was associated with greater inter-session habituation of {EMG} whereas occurrence of {REM} was associated with lesser inter-session habituation of {SCR} to negative stimuli. Sleep may therefore promote emotional adjustment at the level of somatic responses. Physiological but not subjective inter-session habituation to aversive images was enhanced by a daytime nap.},

The anterior cingulate cortex was a part of the initial circuit of Papez thought to be related to the regulation of emotion. However, since then, much experimental work has outlined different cingulate regions with differing anatomical connectivity and functions.

            Major Depressive Disorder ({MDD}) is a widespread mental illness that causes considerable suffering, and neuroimaging studies are trying to reduce this burden by developing biomarkers that can facilitate detection. Prior {fMRI}- and neurostimulation studies suggest that aberrant subgenual Anterior Cingulate ({sgACC})—dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex ({DLPFC}) functional connectivity is consistently present within {MDD}. Combining the need for reliable depression markers with the electroencephalogram’s ({EEG}) high clinical utility, we investigated whether aberrant {EEG} {sgACC}–{DLPFC} functional connectivity could serve as a marker for depression. Source-space Amplitude Envelope Correlations ({AEC}) of 20 {MDD} patients and 20 matched controls were contrasted using non-parametric permutation tests. In addition, extracted {AEC} values were used to (a) correlate with characteristics of depression and (b) train a Support Vector Machine ({SVM}) to determine {sgACC}–{DLPFC} connectivity’s discriminative power. {FDR}-thresholded statistical maps showed reduced {sgACC}–{DLPFC} {AEC} connectivity in {MDD} patients relative to controls. This diminished {AEC} connectivity is located in the beta-1 (13–17 Hz) band and is associated with patients’ lifetime number of depressive episodes. Using extracted {sgACC}–{DLPFC} {AEC} values, the {SVM} achieved a classification accuracy of 84.6\% (80\% sensitivity and 89.5\% specificity) indicating that {EEG} {sgACC}–{DLPFC} connectivity has promise as a biomarker for {MDD}.},

	abstract = {Relative to neutral memories, negative and positive memories both exhibit an increase in memory longevity, subjective memory re-experiencing, and amygdala activation. These memory enhancements are often attributed to shared influences of arousal on memory. Yet prior work suggests the intriguing possibility that arousal affects memory networks in valence-specific ways. Psychophysics work has shown that arousal-related heart rate deceleration ({HRD}) responses are related to enhanced amygdala-visual functional connectivity ({AVFC}) and visual perception of negative stimuli. However, in the memory realm, it is not known if the effect of {AVFC} influences subsequent negative memory outcomes as a function of the magnitude of physiological arousal during encoding. Using psycho-autonomic interaction ({PAI}) analyses and trial-level measures of heart rate deceleration ({HRD}) as an objective measure of arousal during encoding of emotional stimuli, our findings suggest the magnitude of the {HRD} modulates the effect of {AVFC} on subsequent negative memory vividness. Specifically, {AVFC} effects in early visual regions predicted negative memory vividness, not neutral or positive vividness, but only in the presence of heightened physiological arousal. This novel approach was grounded in a replication of prior working showing enhanced {HRD} effects in the insula for negative stimuli. These findings demonstrate that the effect of arousal on emotional memory networks depends on valence and provide further evidence that negative valence may enhance the incorporation of visuo-sensory regions into emotional memory networks.},

We here used targeted memory reactivation ({TMR}) during {REM} sleep to strengthen {IRT}-related memories and accelerate remission of {ND}. Thirty-six patients with {ND} were asked to perform an initial {IRT} session and, while they generated a positive outcome of their nightmare, half of the patients were exposed to a sound ({TMR} group), while no such pairing took place for the other half (control group). During the next 2 weeks, all patients performed {IRT} every evening at home and were exposed to the sound during {REM} sleep with a wireless headband, which automatically detected sleep stages. The frequency of nightmares per week at 2 weeks was used as the primary outcome measure. We found that the {TMR} group had less frequent nightmares and more positive dream emotions than the control group after 2 weeks of {IRT} and a sustained decrease of nightmares after 3 months. By demonstrating the effectiveness of {TMR} during sleep to potentiate therapy, these results have clinical implications for the management of {ND}, with relevance to other psychiatric disorders too. Additionally, these ﬁndings show that {TMR} applied during {REM} sleep can modulate emotions in dreams.},

            Sleep favors the reactivation and consolidation of newly acquired memories. Yet, how our brain selects the noteworthy information to be reprocessed during sleep remains largely unknown. From an evolutionary perspective, individuals must retain information that promotes survival, such as avoiding dangers, finding food, or obtaining praise or money. Here, we test whether neural representations of rewarded (compared to non-rewarded) events have priority for reactivation during sleep. Using functional {MRI} and a brain decoding approach, we show that patterns of brain activity observed during waking behavior spontaneously reemerge during slow-wave sleep. Critically, we report a privileged reactivation of neural patterns previously associated with a rewarded task (i.e., winning at a complex game). Moreover, during sleep, activity in task-related brain regions correlates with better subsequent memory performance. Our study uncovers a neural mechanism whereby rewarded life experiences are preferentially replayed and consolidated while we sleep.},

We ﬁrst trained participants on a rule deﬁning an ordering of objects and then presented a novel set of objects in a scrambled order. Across two studies, we observed that representations of these novel objects were reactivated during a subsequent rest. As in rodents, human ‘‘replay’’ events occurred in sequences accelerated in time, compared to actual experience, and reversed their direction after a reward. Notably, replay did not simply recapitulate visual experience, but followed instead a sequence implied by learned abstract knowledge. Furthermore, each replay contained more than sensory representations of the relevant objects. A sensory code of object representations was preceded 50 ms by a code factorized into sequence position and sequence identity. We argue that this factorized representation facilitates the generalization of a previously learned structure to new objects.},

We utilize the longitudinal Natural Scenes Dataset, a 7-Tesla functional magnetic resonance imaging human study in which ∼135,000 trials of image recognition were conducted over the span of a year among eight subjects. We find that early- and late-stage image recognition associates with both medial temporal lobe ({MTL}) and visual cortex when evaluating regional activations and a multivariate classifier. Supporting multiple-trace theory ({MTT}), parts of the {MTL} activation time course show remarkable fit to a 20-y-old {MTT} time-dynamical model predicting early trace intensity increases and slight subsequent interference (

              {\textgreater} 0.90). These findings contrast a simplistic, yet common, view that memory traces are transferred from {MTL} to cortex. Next, we test the hypothesis that the {MTL} trace signature of memory consolidation should also reflect synaptic “desaturation,” as evidenced by an increased signal-to-noise ratio. We find that the magnitude of relative {BOLD} enhancement among surviving memories is positively linked to the rate of removal (i.e., forgetting) of competing traces. Moreover, an image-feature and time interaction of {MTL} and visual cortex functional connectivity suggests that consolidation mechanisms improve the specificity of a distributed trace. These neurobiological effects do not replicate on a shorter timescale (within a session), implicating a prolonged, offline process. While recognition can potentially involve cognitive processes outside of memory retrieval (e.g., re-encoding), our work largely favors {MTT} and desaturation as perhaps complementary consolidative memory mechanisms.},

	abstract = {A fundamental challenge for systems neuroscience is to quantitatively relate its three major branches of research: brain-activity measurement, behavioral measurement, and computational modeling. Using measured brain-activity patterns to evaluate computational network models is complicated by the need to deﬁne the correspondency between the units of the model and the channels of the brain-activity data, e.g., single-cell recordings or voxels from functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}). Similar correspondency problems complicate relating activity patterns between different modalities of brain-activity measurement (e.g., {fMRI} and invasive or scalp electrophysiology), and between subjects and species. In order to bridge these divides, we suggest abstracting from the activity patterns themselves and computing representational dissimilarity matrices ({RDMs}), which characterize the information carried by a given representation in a brain or model. Building on a rich psychological and mathematical literature on similarity analysis, we propose a new experimental and data-analytical framework called representational similarity analysis ({RSA}), in which multi-channel measures of neural activity are quantitatively related to each other and to computational theory and behavior by comparing {RDMs}. We demonstrate {RSA} by relating representations of visual objects as measured with {fMRI} in early visual cortex and the fusiform face area to computational models spanning a wide range of complexities.The {RDMs} are simultaneously related via second-level application of multidimensional scaling and tested using randomization and bootstrap techniques. We discuss the broad potential of {RSA}, including novel approaches to experimental design, and argue that these ideas, which have deep roots in psychology and neuroscience, will allow the integrated quantitative analysis of data from all three branches, thus contributing to a more uniﬁed systems neuroscience.},

Yet it remains a major challenge to unravel the underlying neuronal mechanisms. Using simultaneous electroencephalography ({EEG}) and functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) recordings in humans, we show that sleep spindles play a key role in the reactivation of memory-related neocortical representations. On separate days, participants either learned face-scene associations or performed a visuomotor control task. Spindle-coupled reactivation of brain regions representing the speciﬁc task stimuli was traced during subsequent {NonREM} sleep with {EEG}-informed {fMRI}. Relative to the control task, learning face-scene associations triggered a stronger combined activation of neocortical and hippocampal regions during subsequent sleep. Notably, reactivation did not only occur in temporal synchrony with spindle events but was tuned by ongoing variations in spindle amplitude. These learningrelated increases in spindle-coupled neocortical activity were topographically speciﬁc because reactivation was restricted to the face- and scene-selective visual cortical areas previously activated during pre-sleep learning. Spindle-coupled hippocampal activation was stronger the better the participant had performed at prior learning. These results are in agreement with the notion that sleep spindles orchestrate the reactivation of new hippocampal–neocortical memories during sleep.},

This reactivation process is thought to aid memory consolidation. Although synaptic rearrangement dynamics following learning involve an interplay between slow-wave sleep ({SWS}) and rapid eye movement ({REM}) sleep, most physiological evidence implicates {SWS} directly following experience as a preferred window for reactivation. Here, we show that reactivation occurs in both {REM} and {SWS} and that coordination of {REM} and {SWS} activation on the same day is associated with rapid learning of a motor skill. We performed 6 h recordings from cells in rats' motor cortex as they were trained daily on a skilled reaching task. In addition to {SWS} following training, reactivation occurred in {REM}, primarily during the pre-task rest period, and {REM} and {SWS} reactivation occurred on the same day in rats that acquired the skill rapidly. Both pre-task {REM} and post-task {SWS} activation were coordinated with muscle activity during sleep, suggesting a functional role for reactivation in skill learning. Our results provide the first demonstration that reactivation in {REM} sleep occurs during motor skill learning and that coordinated reactivation in both sleep states on the same day, although at different times, is beneficial for skill learning.

	abstract = {To study the interplay between hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (Pfc) and its importance for learning and memory consolidation, we measured the coherence in theta oscillations between these two structures in rats learning new rules on a Y maze. Coherence peaked at the choice point, most strongly after task rule acquisition. Simultaneously, Pfc pyramidal neurons reorganized their phase, concentrating at hippocampal theta trough, and synchronous cell assemblies emerged. This synchronous state may result from increased inhibition exerted by interneurons on pyramidal cells, as measured by cross-correlation, and could be modulated by dopamine: we found similar {hippocampalPfc} theta coherence increases and neuronal phase shifts following local administration of dopamine in Pfc of anesthetized rats. Pfc cell assemblies emerging during high coherence were preferentially replayed during subsequent sleep, concurrent with hippocampal sharp waves. Thus, hippocampal/ prefrontal coherence could lead to synchronization of reward predicting activity in prefrontal networks, tagging it for subsequent memory consolidation.},

	abstract = {Relational memory, the flexible ability to generalize across existing stores of information, is a fundamental property of human cognition. Little is known, however, about how and when this inferential knowledge emerges. Here, we test the hypothesis that human relational memory develops during offline time periods. Fifty-six participants initially learned five "premise pairs" (A{\textgreater}B, B{\textgreater}C, C{\textgreater}D, D{\textgreater}E, and E{\textgreater}F). Unknown to subjects, the pairs contained an embedded hierarchy (A{\textgreater}B{\textgreater}C{\textgreater}D{\textgreater}E{\textgreater}F). Following an offline delay of either 20 min, 12 hr (wake or sleep), or 24 hr, knowledge of the hierarchy was tested by examining inferential judgments for novel "inference pairs" (B{\textgreater}D, C{\textgreater}E, and B{\textgreater}E). Despite all groups achieving near-identical premise pair retention after the offline delay (all groups, {\textgreater}85\%; the building blocks of the hierarchy), a striking dissociation was evident in the ability to make relational inference judgments: the 20-min group showed no evidence of inferential ability (52\%), whereas the 12- and 24-hr groups displayed highly significant relational memory developments (inference ability of both groups, {\textgreater}75\%; P {\textless} 0.001). Moreover, if the 12-hr period contained sleep, an additional boost to relational memory was seen for the most distant inferential judgment (the B{\textgreater}E pair; sleep = 93\%, wake = 69\%, P = 0.03). Interestingly, despite this increase in performance, the sleep benefit was not associated with an increase in subjective confidence for these judgments. Together, these findings demonstrate that human relational memory develops during offline time delays. Furthermore, sleep appears to preferentially facilitate this process by enhancing hierarchical memory binding, thereby allowing superior performance for the more distant inferential judgments, a benefit that may operate below the level of conscious awareness. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the {USA}.},

	abstract = {The importance of sleep for memory consolidation has been firmly established over the past decade. Recent work has extended this by suggesting that sleep is also critical for the integration of disparate fragments of information into a unified schema, and for the abstraction of underlying rules. The question of which aspects of sleep play a significant role in integration and abstraction is, however, currently unresolved. Here, we examined the role of sleep in abstraction of the implicit probabilistic structure in sequential stimuli using a statistical learning paradigm, and tested for its role in such abstraction by searching for a predictive relationship between the type of sleep obtained and subsequent performance improvements using polysomnography. In our experiments, participants were exposed to a series of tones in a probabilistically determined sequential structure, and subsequently tested for recognition of novel short sequences adhering to this same statistical pattern in both immediate- and delayed-recall sessions. Participants who consolidated over a night of sleep improved significantly more than those who consolidated over an equivalent period of daytime wakefulness. Similarly, participants who consolidated across a 4-h afternoon delay containing a nap improved significantly more than those who consolidated across an equivalent period without a nap. Importantly, polysomnography revealed a significant correlation between the level of improvement and the amount of slow-wave sleep obtained. We also found evidence of a time-based consolidation process which operates alongside sleep-specific consolidation. These results demonstrate that abstraction of statistical patterns benefits from sleep, and provide the first clear support for the role of slow-wave sleep in this consolidation. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

This is consistent with the long-held view that ripples participate in strengthening and reorganizing memory traces, possibly by mediating information transfer to neocortical areas. Recent studies have confirmed that ripples and associated neuronal reactivations play a causal role in memory consolidation during sleep and rest.

In this review we aim to comprehensively cover the field of "sleep and memory" research by providing a historical perspective on concepts and a discussion of more recent key findings. Whereas initial theories posed a passive role for sleep enhancing memories by protecting them from interfering stimuli, current theories highlight an active role for sleep in which memories undergo a process of system consolidation during sleep. Whereas older research concentrated on the role of rapid-eye-movement ({REM}) sleep, recent work has revealed the importance of slow-wave sleep ({SWS}) for memory consolidation and also enlightened some of the underlying electrophysiological, neurochemical, and genetic mechanisms, as well as developmental aspects in these processes. Specifically, newer findings characterize sleep as a brain state optimizing memory consolidation, in opposition to the waking brain being optimized for encoding of memories. Consolidation originates from reactivation of recently encoded neuronal memory representations, which occur during {SWS} and transform respective representations for integration into long-term memory. Ensuing {REM} sleep may stabilize transformed memories. While elaborated with respect to hippocampus-dependent memories, the concept of an active redistribution of memory representations from networks serving as temporary store into long-term stores might hold also for non-hippocampus-dependent memory, and even for nonneuronal, i.e., immunological memories, giving rise to the idea that the offline consolidation of memory during sleep represents a principle of long-term memory formation established in quite different physiological systems. © 2013 the American Physiological Society.},

Slow-Wave Sleep ({SWS}) is typically associated with the consolidation of non-emotional memories. However, the effects of {REM} sleep and {SWS} on emotional memory consolidation have not been investigated in participants reporting depressive symptoms. In this study, we recruited two groups of healthy participants; one reporting mild-to-moderate depressive symptoms, and another reporting minimal depressive symptoms (assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory; {BDI}-{II}). Using a within-subjects split-night design, we measured consolidation of positive, neutral and negative images across a 3 h retention interval rich in either {REM} sleep or {SWS}. We found a significant sleep condition x image valence interaction in participants reporting depressive symptoms [F (2, 20) = 4.73, p =.021], but not participants reporting minimal depressive symptoms [F (2, 22) =.17, p =.845]. Participants reporting depressive symptoms consolidated significantly more neutral memories during {SWS}, and marginally more negative memories during {REM} sleep, than those reporting minimal depressive symptoms [t (21) = 2.44, p =.023; t (21) = 1.96, p =.064, respectively]. Our preliminary results demonstrate that {REM} sleep and {SWS} have differential effects on the consolidation of emotional and neutral images in participants reporting depressive symptoms.

Recently, this memory enhancement due to a prior schema has been suggested to be based on rapid neocortical assimilation of new information, related to optimized encoding and consolidation processes. The medial prefrontal cortex ({mPFC}) is thought to be important in mediating this process, but its role in retrieval of schema-consistent information is still unclear. In this study, we regarded multisensory congruency with prior knowledge as a schema and used this factor to probe retrieval of consolidated memories either consistent or inconsistent with prior knowledge. We conducted a visuotactile learning paradigm in which participants studied visual motifs randomly associated with word-fabric combinations that were either congruent or incongruent with common knowledge. The next day, participants were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging while their memory was tested. Congruent associations were remembered better than incongruent ones. This behavioral finding was parallelized by stronger retrieval-related activity in and connectivity between medial prefrontal and left somatosensory cortex. Moreover, we found a positive across-subject correlation between the connectivity enhancement and the behavioral congruency effect. These results show that successful retrieval of congruent compared to incongruent visuotactile associations is related to enhanced processing in an {mPFC}-somatosensory network, and support the hypothesis that new information that fits a preexisting schema is more rapidly assimilated in neocortical networks, a process that may be mediated, at least in part, by the {mPFC}.

The role of sleep is to downscale synaptic strength to a baseline level that is energetically sustainable, makes efficient use of gray matter space, and is beneficial for learning and memory. Thus, sleep is the price we have to pay for plasticity, and its goal is the homeostatic regulation of the total synaptic weight impinging on neurons.

	abstract = {The hippocampus is thought to promote gradual incorporation of novel information into long-term memory by binding, reactivating, and strengthening distributed cortical-cortical connections. Recent studies implicate a key role in this process for hippocampally driven crosstalk with the (ventro)medial prefrontal cortex ({vmPFC}), which is proposed to become a central node in such representational networks over time. The existence of a relevant prior associative network, or schema, may more over facilitate this process. Thus, hippocampal-{vmPFC} crosstalk may support integration of new memories, particularly in the absence of a relevant prior schema. To address this issue, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) and prior schema manipulation to track hippocampal-{vmPFC} connectivity during encoding and postencoding rest. We manipulated prior schema knowledge by exposing 30 participants to the first part of a movie that was temporally scrambled for 15 participants. The next day, participants underwent {fMRI} while encoding the movie's final 15 min in original order and, subsequently, while resting. Schema knowledge and item recognition performance show that prior schema was successfully and selectively manipulated. Intersubject synchronization ({ISS}) and interregional partial correlation analyses furthermore show that stronger prior schema was associated with more {vmPFC} {ISS} and less hippocampal-{vmPFC} interregional connectivity during encoding. Notably, this connectivity pattern persisted during postencoding rest. These findings suggest that additional crosstalk between hippocampus and {vmPFC} is required to compensate for difficulty integrating novel information during encoding and provide tentative support for the notion that functionally relevant hippocampal-neocortical crosstalk persists during off-line periods after learning.},

(2016) found that a solution accompanied with sudden insight is more likely to be correct than a problem solved through conscious and incremental steps. However, Metcalfe (1986) indicated that participants would often present an inelegant but plausible (wrong) answer as correct with a high feeling of warmth (a subjective measure of closeness to solution). This discrepancy may be due to the use of different tasks or due to different methods in the measurement of insight (i.e., using a binary vs. continuous scale). In three experiments, we investigated both findings, using many different problem tasks (e.g., Compound Remote Associates, so-called classic insight problems, and non-insight problems). Participants rated insight-related affect (feelings of Aha-experience, confidence, surprise, impasse, and pleasure) on continuous scales. As expected we found that, for problems designed to elicit insight, correct solutions elicited higher proportions of reported insight in the solution compared to non-insight solutions; further, correct solutions elicited stronger feelings of insight compared to incorrect solutions.},

To this end, we review some theoretical and methodological obstacles that are inherent in the investigation of the existence and nature of restruc- turing processes.

New traces, trained for only one trial, then became assimilated and rapidly hippocampal-independent. Schemas also played a causal role in the creation of lasting associative memory representations during one-trial learning.

We examined how targeted memory reactivation during sleep, which boosts next-day solving, relates to forgetting fixation, a well-supported explanation of awake incubation. In evening sessions, participants attempted puzzles, while a unique sound cue played during each puzzle. Half the time, puzzles included fixating information reinforcing an incorrect representation. Later, during deep sleep, sounds associated with half of participants’ previously unsolved puzzles were presented. The sounds should strengthen puzzle memories and reduce forgetting of the fixating information. In morning solving, overnight cueing reliably interacted with fixating information: participants solved numerically more cued than uncued puzzles, but only when puzzles included fixating information. These results suggest that additional processing occurred beyond simple fixation forgetting.},

	abstract = {For two decades, sleep has been touted as one of the primary drivers for the encoding, consolidation, retention, and retrieval of episodic emotional memory. Recently, however, sleep’s role in emotional memory processing has received renewed scrutiny as meta-analyses and reviews have indicated that sleep may only contribute a small effect that hinges on the content or context of the learning and retrieval episodes. On the one hand, the strong perception of sleep’s importance in maintaining memory for emotional events may have been exacerbated by publication bias phenomena, such as the “winner’s curse” and “file drawer problem.” On the other hand, it is plausible that there are sets of circumstances that lead to consistent and reliable effects of sleep on emotional memory; these circumstances may depend on factors such as the placement and quality of sleep relative to the emotional experience, the content and context of the emotional experience, and the probes and strategies used to assess memory at retrieval. Here, we review the literature on how sleep (and sleep loss) influences each stage of emotional episodic memory. Specifically, we have separated previous work based on the placement of sleep and sleep loss in relation to the different stages of emotional memory processing: (1) prior to encoding, (2) immediately following encoding during early consolidation, (3) during extended consolidation, separated from initial learning, (4) just prior to retrieval, and (5) post-retrieval as memories may be restructured and reconsolidated. The goals of this review are three-fold: (1) examine phases of emotional memory that sleep may influence to a greater or lesser degree, (2) explicitly identify problematic overlaps in traditional sleep–wake study designs that are preventing the ability to better disentangle the potential role of sleep in the different stages of emotional memory processing, and (3) highlight areas for future research by identifying the stages of emotional memory processing in which the effect of sleep and sleep loss remains under-investigated. Here, we begin the task of better understanding the contexts and factors that influence the relationship between sleep and emotional memory processing and aim to be a valuable resource to facilitate hypothesis generation and promote important future research.},

However, it remains unclear how learning and consolidation requirements influence and regulate subsequent {SPW}-R activity. Indeed, {SPW}-R activity has been observed not only following complex behavioral tasks, but also after random foraging in familiar environments, despite markedly different learning requirements. Because transient increases in {SPW}-R rates have been reported following training on memory tasks, we hypothesized that {SPW}-R activity following learning (but not routine behavior) could involve specific regulatory processes related to ongoing consolidation. Interfering with ripples would then result in a dynamic compensatory response only when initial memory traces required consolidation. Here we trained rats on a spatial memory task, and showed that subsequent sleep periods where ripple activity was perturbed by timed electrical stimulation were indeed characterized by increased {SPW}-R occurrence rates compared with control sleep periods where stimulations were slightly delayed in time and did not interfere with ripples. Importantly, this did not occur following random foraging in a familiar environment.Wenext showed that this dynamic response was abolished following injection of an {NMDA} receptor blocker ({MK}-801) before, but not after training. Our results indicate that {NMDA} receptor-dependent processes occurring during learning, such as network "tagging" and plastic changes, regulate subsequent ripplemediated consolidation of spatial memory during sleep. © 2014 the authors.},

This effect, which declined gradually during each post-behavior sleep session, may result from synaptic modification during waking experience. Information acquired during active behavior is thus re-expressed in hippocampal circuits during sleep, as postulated by some theories of memory consolidation.},

	abstract = {Study Objectives: Memory reactivation appears to be a fundamental process in memory consolidation. In this study we tested the influence of memory reactivation during rapid eye movement ({REM}) sleep on memory performance and brain responses at retrieval in healthy human participants. Participants: Fifty-six healthy subjects (28 women and 28 men, age [mean ± standard deviation]: 21.6 ± 2.2 y) participated in this functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) study. Methods and Results: Auditory cues were associated with pictures of faces during their encoding. These memory cues delivered during {REM} sleep enhanced subsequent accurate recollections but also false recognitions. These results suggest that reactivated memories interacted with semantically related representations, and induced new creative associations, which subsequently reduced the distinction between new and previously encoded exemplars. Cues had no effect if presented during stage 2 sleep, or if they were not associated with faces during encoding. Functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed that following exposure to conditioned cues during {REM} sleep, responses to faces during retrieval were enhanced both in a visual area and in a cortical region of multisensory (auditory-visual) convergence. Conclusions: These results show that reactivating memories during {REM} sleep enhances cortical responses during retrieval, suggesting the integration of recent memories within cortical circuits, favoring the generalization and schematization of the information.},

Stimulus-specific activity was identified using representational similarity analysis and then tracked during waking rest and sleep after encoding. Stimulus-specific gamma (30–90 Hz) activity during early (100–500 ms) and late (500–1200 ms) encoding is spontaneously reactivated during waking state and sleep, independent of later memory.

Ripple-triggered replay of activity from the early time window during {nREM} sleep is enhanced for forgotten items.

	abstract = {Memory consolidation transforms initially labile memory traces into more stable representations. One putative mechanism for consolidation is the reactivation of memory traces after their initial encoding during subsequent sleep or waking state. However, it is still unknown whether consolidation of individual memory contents relies on reactivation of stimulus-specific neural representations in humans. Investigating stimulus-specific representations in humans is particularly difficult, but potentially feasible using multivariate pattern classification analysis ({MVPA}). Here, we show in healthy human participants that stimulus-specific activation patterns can indeed be identified with {MVPA}, that these patterns reoccur spontaneously during postlearning resting periods and sleep, and that the frequency of reactivation predicts subsequent memory for individual items. We conducted a paired-associate learning task with items and spatial positions and extracted stimulus-specific activity patterns by {MVPA} in a simultaneous electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) study. As a first step, we investigated the amount of {fMRI} volumes during rest that resembled either one of the items shown before or one of the items shown as a control after the resting period. Reactivations during both awake resting state and sleep predicted subsequent memory. These data are first evidence that spontaneous reactivation of stimulus-specific activity patterns during resting state can be investigated using {MVPA}. They show that reactivation occurs in humans and is behaviorally relevant for stabilizing memory traces against interference. They move beyond previous studies because replay was investigated on the level of individual stimuli and because reactivations were not evoked by sensory cues but occurred spontaneously. © 2013 the authors.},

	abstract = {How are brief encounters transformed into lasting memories? Previous research has established the role of non-rapid eye movement ({NREM}) sleep, along with its electrophysiological signatures of slow oscillations ({SOs}) and spindles, for memory consolidation [1–4]. In related work, experimental manipulations have demonstrated that {NREM} sleep provides a window of opportunity to selectively strengthen particular memory traces via the delivery of auditory cues [5–10], a procedure known as targeted memory reactivation ({TMR}). It has remained unclear, however, whether {TMR} triggers the brain's endogenous consolidation mechanisms (linked to {SOs} and/or spindles) and whether those mechanisms in turn mediate effective processing of mnemonic information. We devised a novel paradigm in which associative memories (adjective-object and adjective-scene pairs) were selectively cued during a post-learning nap, successfully stabilizing next-day retention relative to non-cued memories. First, we found that, compared to novel control adjectives, memory cues evoked an increase in fast spindles. Critically, during the time window of cue-induced spindle activity, the memory category linked to the verbal cue (object or scene) could be reliably decoded, with the fidelity of this decoding predicting the behavioral consolidation benefits of {TMR}. These results provide correlative evidence for an information processing role of sleep spindles in service of memory consolidation. Sleep spindles play a crucial role in memory consolidation, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Using an auditory memory-cueing technique and {EEG} analysis in humans, Cairney et al. show that sleep spindles mediate the informational content of reactivated memory traces in service of offline mnemonic processing.},

Yet it remains a major challenge to unravel the underlying neuronal mechanisms. Using simultaneous electroencephalography ({EEG}) and functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) recordings in humans, we show that sleep spindles play a key role in the reactivation of memory-related neocortical representations. On separate days, participants either learned face-scene associations or performed a visuomotor control task. Spindle-coupled reactivation of brain regions representing the specific task stimuli was traced during subsequent {NonREM} sleep with {EEG}-informed {fMRI}. Relative to the control task, learning face-scene associations triggered a stronger combined activation of neocortical and hippocampal regions during subsequent sleep. Notably, reactivation did not only occur in temporal synchrony with spindle events but was tuned by ongoing variations in spindle amplitude. These learning-related increases in spindle-coupled neocortical activity were topographically specific because reactivation was restricted to the face- and scene-selective visual cortical areas previously activated during pre-sleep learning. Spindle-coupled hippocampal activation was stronger the better the participant had performed at prior learning. These results are in agreement with the notion that sleep spindles orchestrate the reactivation of new hippocampal-neocortical memories during sleep. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

Their excitatory output affects a wide area of the cortex and several subcortical nuclei. {SPW}-Rs occur during "off-line" states of the brain, associated with consummatory behaviors and non-{REM} sleep, and are influenced by numerous neurotransmitters and neuromodulators. They arise from the excitatory recurrent system of the {CA}3 region and the {SPW}-induced excitation brings about a fast network oscillation (ripple) in {CA}1. The spike content of {SPW}-Rs is temporally and spatially coordinated by a consortium of interneurons to replay fragments of waking neuronal sequences in a compressed format. {SPW}-Rs assist in transferring this compressed hippocampal representation to distributed circuits to support memory consolidation; selective disruption of {SPW}-Rs interferes with memory. Recently acquired and pre-existing information are combined during {SPW}-R replay to influence decisions, plan actions and, potentially, allow for creative thoughts. In addition to the widely studied contribution to memory, {SPW}-Rs may also affect endocrine function via activation of hypothalamic circuits. Alteration of the physiological mechanisms supporting {SPW}-Rs leads to their pathological conversion, "p-ripples," which are a marker of epileptogenic tissue and can be observed in rodent models of schizophrenia and Alzheimer's Disease.

However, recent evidence indicates that the hippocampus mediates rapid associative learning with and without consciousness in humans and animals, for long-term and short-term retention. Consciousness seems to be a poor criterion for differentiating between declarative (or explicit) and nondeclarative (or implicit) types of memory. A new model is therefore required in which memory systems are distinguished based on the processing operations involved rather than by consciousness. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

In doing so, they relied predominantly on a template derived from the expression of {REM} sleep in the adults of a small number of mammalian species. Here, we argue for a different approach that focuses less on a binary decision about haves and have nots, and more on the diverse expression of {REM} sleep components over development and across species. By focusing on the components of {REM} sleep and discouraging continued reliance on a restricted template, we aim to promote a richer and more biologically grounded developmental–comparative approach that spans behavioral, physiological, neural, and ecological domains. Blumberg et al. describe {REM} sleep during different times of development and across various species, arguing for a more biologically grounded developmental-comparative approach to understanding {REM} sleep and its components.

We investigated the role of sleep in experience-dependent dendritic spine elimination of layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the visual (V1) and frontal association cortex ({FrA}) of 1-month-old mice. We found that monocular deprivation ({MD}) or auditory-cued fear conditioning ({FC}) caused rapid spine elimination in V1 or {FrA}, respectively. {MD}- or {FC}-induced spine elimination was significantly reduced after total sleep or {REM} sleep deprivation. Total sleep or {REM} sleep deprivation also prevented {MD}- and {FC}-induced reduction of neuronal activity in response to visual or conditioned auditory stimuli. Furthermore, dendritic calcium spikes increased substantially during {REM} sleep, and the blockade of these calcium spikes prevented {MD}- and {FC}-induced spine elimination. These findings reveal an important role of {REM} sleep in experience-dependent synapse elimination and neuronal activity reduction.},

	abstract = {Rapid eye movement ({REM}) sleep is characterized by the alternation of two markedly different microstates, phasic and tonic {REM}. These periods differ in awakening and arousal thresholds, sensory processing, and spontaneous cortical oscillations. Previous studies indicate that although in phasic {REM}, cortical activity is independent of the external environment, attentional functions and sensory processing are partially maintained during tonic periods. Large-scale synchronization of oscillatory activity, especially in the α- and β-frequency ranges, can accurately distinguish different states of vigilance and cognitive processes of enhanced alertness and attention. Therefore, we examined long-range inter- and intrahemispheric as well as short-range electroencephalographic synchronization during phasic and tonic {REM} periods quantified by the weighted phase lag index. Based on the nocturnal polysomnographic data of 19 healthy adult participants, we showed that long-range inter- and intrahemispheric α and β synchrony was enhanced in tonic {REM} states in contrast to phasic ones, and resembled α and β synchronization of resting wakefulness. On the other hand, short-range synchronization within the γ 3-frequency range was higher in phasic compared with tonic periods. Increased short-range synchrony might reflect local and inwardly driven sensorimotor activity during phasic {REM} periods, whereas enhanced long-range synchrony might index frontoparietal activity that reinstates environmental alertness after phasic {REM} periods.},

We propose here that differentiating and exploring the fine microstructure of {REM} sleep, especially its phasic and tonic constituents would provide a novel framework to examine the mechanisms and putative functions of {REM} sleep. In this review, we show that phasic and tonic {REM} periods are remarkably different neural states with respect to environmental alertness, spontaneous and evoked cortical activity, information processing, and seem to contribute differently to the dysfunctions of {REM} sleep in several neurological and psychiatric disorders.

Neurosci. 3 (2000) 831-836), suggesting that {REM} sleep participates in the reprocessing of recent memory traces in humans. However, the nature of the reprocessed information remains open. Here, we show that regional cerebral reactivation during posttraining {REM} sleep is not merely related to the acquisition of basic visuomotor skills during prior practice of the serial reaction time task, but rather to the implicit acquisition of the probabilistic rules that defined stimulus sequences. Moreover, functional connections between the reactivated cuneus and the striatum - the latter being critical for implicit sequence learning - are reinforced during {REM} sleep after practice on a probabilistic rather than on a random sequence of stimuli. Our results therefore support the hypothesis that {REM} sleep is deeply involved in the reprocessing and optimization of the high-order information contained in the material to be learned. In addition, we show that the level of acquisition of probabilistic rules attained prior to sleep is correlated to the increase in regional cerebral blood flow during subsequent {REM} sleep. This suggests that posttraining cerebral reactivation is modulated by the strength of the memory traces developed during the learning episode. Our data provide the first experimental evidence for a link between behavioral performance and cerebral reactivation during {REM} sleep. © 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

It is not clear whether these changes are task specific, or the result of learning in general. The current study investigated changes in spindles, rapid eye movements, K-complexes and {EEG} spectral power following learning in good sleepers randomly assigned to one of four learning conditions: Pursuit Rotor (n = 9), Mirror Tracing (n = 9), Paired Associates (n = 9), and non-learning controls (n = 9). Following Pursuit Rotor learning, there was an increase in the duration of Stage 2 sleep, spindle density (number of spindles/min), average spindle duration, and an increase in low frequency sigma power (12-14 Hz) at occipital regions during {SWS} and at frontal regions during Stage 2 sleep in the second half of the night. These findings are consistent with previous findings that Pursuit Rotor learning is consolidated during Stage 2 sleep, and provide additional data to suggest that spindles across all non-{REM} stages may be a mechanism for brain plasticity. Following Paired Associates learning, theta power increased significantly at central regions during {REM} sleep. This study provides the first evidence that {REM} sleep theta activity is involved in declarative memory consolidation. Together, these findings support the hypothesis that brain plasticity during sleep does not involve a unitary process; that is, different types of learning have unique sleep-related memory consolidation mechanisms that act in dissociable brain regions at different times throughout the night. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

With the reality that invasive recordings performed on animals cannot be replicated in humans; while animals themselves cannot convey experience to the extent required to elucidate how {PGO} waves factor into awareness and behavior, innovative solutions are required if significant research outcomes are to ever be realized. Advances in non-invasive imaging technologies and sophistication in imaging methods now offer substantial scope to renew the study of the electrophysiological substrates of waking and dreaming perception. Among these, Magnetoencephalogram ({MEG}) stands out through its capacity to measure deep brain activations with high temporal resolution. With the current trend in sleep and dream research to produce translational findings of psychopathological and medical significance, in addition to the clear links that {PGO} wave generation sites share, pharmacologically, with receptors involved in expression of mental illness; there is a strong case to support scientific research into {PGO} waves and develop a functional understanding of their broader role in human perception.},

Seventeen healthy adults (age 35-65 years) without sleep disorders underwent 5-14 days of actigraphy, followed by slow wave activity disruption during polysomnogram, and cerebrospinal fluid collection the following morning for measurement of amyloid-β, tau, total protein, {YKL}-40, and hypocretin. Data were compared to an identical protocol, with a sham condition during polysomnogram. Specific disruption of slow wave activity correlated with an increase in amyloid-β 40 (r = 0.610, P = 0.009). This effect was specific for slow wave activity, and not for sleep duration or efficiency. This effect was also specific to amyloid-β, and not total protein, tau, {YKL}-40, or hypocretin. Additionally, worse home sleep quality, as measured by sleep efficiency by actigraphy in the six nights preceding lumbar punctures, was associated with higher tau (r = 0.543, P = 0.045). Slow wave activity disruption increases amyloid-β levels acutely, and poorer sleep quality over several days increases tau.

Deep non-rapid eye movement ({NREM}) sleep, also known as slow-wave sleep ({SWS}), is thought to be the most ''restorative'' sleep stage, but beneficial effects of {SWS} for physical well being have not been demonstrated. The initiation of {SWS} coincides with hormonal changes that affect glucose regulation, suggesting that {SWS} may be important for normal glucose tolerance. If this were so, selective suppression of {SWS} should adversely affect glucose homeostasis and increase the risk of type 2 diabetes. Here we show that, in young healthy adults, all-night selective suppression of {SWS}, without any change in total sleep time, results in marked decreases in insulin sensitivity without adequate compensatory increase in insulin release, leading to reduced glucose tolerance and increased diabetes risk. {SWS} suppression reduced delta spectral power, the dominant {EEG} frequency range in {SWS}, and left other {EEG} frequency bands unchanged. Importantly, the magnitude of the decrease in insulin sensitivity was strongly correlated with the magnitude of the reduction in {SWS}. These findings demonstrate a clear role for {SWS} in the maintenance of normal glucose homeostasis. Furthermore, our data suggest that reduced sleep quality with low levels of {SWS}, as occurs in aging and in many obese individuals, may contribute to increase the risk of type 2 diabetes. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the {USA}.},

	abstract = {Reduced sleep duration and quality appear to be endemic in modern society. Curtailment of the bedtime period to minimum tolerability is thought to be efficient and harmless by many. It has been known for several decades that sleep is a major modulator of hormonal release, glucose regulation and cardiovascular function. In particular, slow wave sleep ({SWS}), thought to be the most restorative sleep stage, is associated with decreased heart rate, blood pressure, sympathetic nervous activity and cerebral glucose utilization, compared with wakefulness. During {SWS}, the anabolic growth hormone is released while the stress hormone cortisol is inhibited. In recent years, laboratory and epidemiologic evidence have converged to indicate that sleep loss may be a novel risk factor for obesity and type 2 diabetes. The increased risk of obesity is possibly linked to the effect of sleep loss on hormones that play a major role in the central control of appetite and energy expenditure, such as leptin and ghrelin. Reduced leptin and increased ghrelin levels correlate with increases in subjective hunger when individuals are sleep restricted rather than well rested. Given the evidence, sleep curtailment appears to be an important, yet modifiable, risk factor for the metabolic syndrome, diabetes and obesity. The marked decrease in average sleep duration in the last 50 years coinciding with the increased prevalence of obesity, together with the observed adverse effects of recurrent partial sleep deprivation on metabolism and hormonal processes, may have important implications for public health. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {There is convincing evidence that, in humans, discrete sleep stages are important for daytime brain function, but whether any particular sleep stage has functional significance for the rest of the body is not known. Deep non-rapid eye movement ({NREM}) sleep, also known as slow-wave sleep ({SWS}), is thought to be the most ''restorative'' sleep stage, but beneficial effects of {SWS} for physical well being have not been demonstrated. The initiation of {SWS} coincides with hormonal changes that affect glucose regulation, suggesting that {SWS} may be important for normal glucose tolerance. If this were so, selective suppression of {SWS} should adversely affect glucose homeostasis and increase the risk of type 2 diabetes. Here we show that, in young healthy adults, all-night selective suppression of {SWS}, without any change in total sleep time, results in marked decreases in insulin sensitivity without adequate compensatory increase in insulin release, leading to reduced glucose tolerance and increased diabetes risk. {SWS} suppression reduced delta spectral power, the dominant {EEG} frequency range in {SWS}, and left other {EEG} frequency bands unchanged. Importantly, the magnitude of the decrease in insulin sensitivity was strongly correlated with the magnitude of the reduction in {SWS}. These findings demonstrate a clear role for {SWS} in the maintenance of normal glucose homeostasis. Furthermore, our data suggest that reduced sleep quality with low levels of {SWS}, as occurs in aging and in many obese individuals, may contribute to increase the risk of type 2 diabetes. aging sleep quality sleep disordered breathing delta waves insulin resistance H uman sleep is composed of rapid-eye-movement ({REM}) sleep and stages 1, 2, 3, and 4 of non-{REM} ({NREM}) sleep. The deeper stages of {NREM} sleep, i.e., stages 3 and 4, also known as slow-wave sleep ({SWS}), are thought to be the most ''restorative.'' There is indeed evidence that {SWS} plays a role in waking neurobehavioral function (1), particularly in memory consolidation (2, 3), but whether {SWS} is also important for peripheral physiological function is not known. The initiation of {SWS} is temporally associated with transient metabolic, hormonal , and neurophysiologic changes, all of which could potentially affect glucose homeostasis. These include decreased brain glucose utilization, stimulation of growth hormone release, inhibition of corticotropic activity, decreased sympathetic nervous activity, and increased vagal tone. We therefore hypothesized that {SWS} plays a role in glucose regulation and that suppression of {SWS} may adversely affect glucose homeostasis. To test this hypothesis, we developed an experimental model in young healthy lean individuals that was designed to selectively suppress {SWS} and assessed the impact of this intervention on glucose homeostasis. The {EEG} was continuously monitored, and {SWS} was suppressed by delivering acoustic stimuli of varying frequencies and intensities. The intervention was designed to substitute deep {NREM} sleep, i.e., stages 3 and 4, with shallow {NREM} sleep, i.e., stage 2, without awakening the subject, changing total sleep duration or the amount of {REM} sleep. Nine healthy young volunteers were each tested under two experimental conditions in randomized order: (i) after 2 consecutive nights of undisturbed ''baseline'' sleep and (ii) after 3 consecutive nights of ''experimental suppression of {SWS}''. During each night, the depth or intensity of {SWS} was quantified by delta spectral power, i.e., the dominant {EEG} frequency range (0.5-4 Hz) in {SWS}. Glucose regulation was assessed by i.v. glucose tolerance testing ({ivGTT}) at the end of each experimental condition. Glucose tolerance was quantified by the rate of decline in glucose levels after i.v. glucose injection. We simultaneously evaluated insulin sensitivity (S.I.) and insulin secretion [the ''acute insulin response to glucose'' ({AIRg})] by using minimal model analysis of blood glucose and insulin levels measured during the {ivGTT} (4). Results After 3 nights of experimental suppression of {SWS}, S.I. was decreased by 25\% (Fig. 1a), reaching the level reported for populations at high risk for diabetes (4). The magnitude of the change in S.I. was comparable with that associated with a difference in weight of 8-13 kg (5). The decrease in S.I. was remarkably consistent, occurring in all but one subject. Under normal circumstances, when S.I. decreases, the insulin response ({AIRg}) should increase reciprocally such that the disposition index ({DI}) ({DI} S.I. {AIRg}) remains constant and glucose tolerance is maintained (6). However, after {SWS} suppression, the decrease in S.I. was not compensated by an increase in insulin release, because {AIRg} remained virtually unchanged (Fig. 1b). Inadequate beta cell compensation for a given decrease in S.I. results in a fall in {DI}, which is a validated marker of diabetes risk (7-10). Indeed, the {DI} was 20\% lower after {SWS} suppression (Fig. 1c). Consistent with an increased diabetes risk, glucose tolerance was reduced by 23\% (Fig. 1d) to within the range reported in older adults with impaired glucose tolerance (11). We explored the associations between the changes in S.I. and {AIRg} and the changes in {SWS} (Fig. 2). Individuals with high {SWS} at baseline maintained higher levels of {SWS} after intervention (Fig. 2a), despite experiencing larger decreases in {SWS} (Fig. 2b). In contrast, individuals with low {SWS} at baseline were suppressed to extremely low {SWS} levels by the intervention. Remarkably, the magnitudes of the changes in both S.I. (Fig. 2c) and {AIRg} (Fig. 2d) after 3 nights of {SWS} suppression were correlated with the magnitude of the change in the amount of {SWS} but beta cell responsiveness (i.e., {AIRg}) did not fully compensate for the decrease in S.I. Individuals with low {SWS} at baseline had greater decreases in S.I. with some compensatory increases in {AIRg}. However, only one subject had an increase in {AIRg} sufficient to compensate for the decrease in S.I. Individ},

It is unknown whether slow oscillations are synchronous across the majority or the minority of brain regions-are they a global or local phenomenon? To examine this, we recorded simultaneously scalp {EEG}, intracerebral {EEG}, and unit firing in multiple brain regions of neurosurgical patients. We find that most sleep slow waves and the underlying active and inactive neuronal states occur locally. Thus, especially in late sleep, some regions can be active while others are silent. We also find that slow waves can propagate, usually from medial prefrontal cortex to the medial temporal lobe and hippocampus. Sleep spindles, the other hallmark of {NREM} sleep {EEG}, are likewise predominantly local. Thus, intracerebral communication during sleep is constrained because slow and spindle oscillations often occur out-of-phase in different brain regions. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Slow-wave sleep ({SWS}) facilitates the consolidation of hippocampus-dependent declarative memory. Based on the standard two-stage memory model, we propose that memory consolidation during {SWS} represents a process of system consolidation which is orchestrated by the neocortical {\textless} 1 Hz electroencephalogram ({EEG}) slow oscillation and involves the reactivation of newly encoded representations and their subsequent redistribution from temporary hippocampal to neocortical long-term storage sites. Indeed, experimental induction of slow oscillations during non-rapid eye movement (non-{REM}) sleep by slowly alternating transcranial current stimulation distinctly improves consolidation of declarative memory. The slow oscillations temporally group neuronal activity into up-states of strongly enhanced neuronal activity and down-states of neuronal silence. In a feed-forward efferent action, this grouping is induced not only in the neocortex but also in other structures relevant to consolidation, namely the thalamus generating 10-15. Hz spindles, and the hippocampus generating sharp wave-ripples, with the latter well known to accompany a replay of newly encoded memories taking place in hippocampal circuitries. The feed-forward synchronizing effect of the slow oscillation enables the formation of spindle-ripple events where ripples and accompanying reactivated hippocampal memory information become nested into the single troughs of spindles. Spindle-ripple events thus enable reactivated memory-related hippocampal information to be fed back to neocortical networks in the excitable slow oscillation up-state where they can induce enduring plastic synaptic changes underlying the effective formation of long-term memories. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

This slow oscillation is the fundamental cellular phenomenon that organizes other sleep rhythms such as spindles and slow waves. Using high-density electroencephalogram recordings in humans, we show here that each cycle of the slow oscillation is a traveling wave. Each wave originates at a definite site and travels over the scalp at an estimated speed of 1.2-7.0 m/sec. Waves originate more frequently in prefrontal-orbitofrontal regions and propagate in an anteroposterior direction. Their rate of occurrence increases progressively reaching almost once per second as sleep deepens. The pattern of origin and propagation of sleep slow oscillations is reproducible across nights and subjects and provides a blueprint of cortical excitability and connectivity. The orderly propagation of correlated activity along connected pathways may play a role in spike timing-dependent synaptic plasticity during sleep.},

Studying the K-complex in primary insomnia, for which sleep protection appears to be of central importance, may provide further insight on its role. The purpose of the present study was to determine the role of spontaneous and evoked K-complexes in good sleepers and to investigate its role in primary insomnia. Participants: Twelve individuals with primary insomnia (mean age = 45.4 years) and 12 good-sleeper controls (mean age = 44.3 years). Methods and Procedure: Participants underwent 4 consecutive nights of polysomnographic recordings. Spontaneous K-complexes ({SKC}) were analyzed during continuous stage 2 sleep on the third night, whereas evoked K-complexes ({EKC}) were elicited by auditory stimuli on the fourth night. Relative spectral power was measured on 1-second electroencephalographic segments prior to and following {SKC}, {EKC}, and trials in which auditory stimuli did not elicit a K-complex ({EKC}-). K-complex amplitudes were also measured. Results: Measures of relative spectral power showed significant changes following {EKC} (increase in activity in the delta frequency band and decrease in activity in the theta, sigma, beta, and gamma frequency bands) and {SKC} (increase in activity in delta frequency band and decrease in activity in theta, alpha, sigma, and beta frequency bands) for good sleepers, whereas there was no such marked change in electroencephalographic activity surrounding {EKC}-. A similar pattern of electroencephalographic activity was also observed for the insomnia group on trials of each different K-complex. Auditory stimuli elicited the same proportion of {EKC} for both groups, whereas {SKC} density was higher for the insomnia group (1.52 {SKC}/min) than for good sleepers (1.06 {SKC}/minute) Conclusion: These results suggest that the {SKC} and the {EKC} both promote deeper sleep, further supporting a sleep-protection role.},

	abstract = {The large multicomponent K-complex ({KC}) and the rhythmic spindle are the hallmarks of non-rapid eye movement ({NREM})-2 sleep stage. We studied with magnetoencephalography ({MEG}) the progress of light sleep ({NREM}-1 and {NREM}-2) and emergence of {KCs} and spindles. Seven periods of interest ({POI}) were analyzed: wakefulness, the two quiet “core” periods of light sleep (periods free from any prominent phasic or oscillatory events) and four periods before and during spindles and {KCs}. For each {POI}, eight 2-s (1250 time slices) segments were used. We employed magnetic field tomography ({MFT}) to extract an independent tomographic estimate of brain activity from each {MEG} data sample. The spectral power was then computed for each voxel in the brain for each segment of each {POI}. The sets of eight maps from two {POIs} were contrasted using a voxel-by-voxel t-test. Only increased spectral power was identified in the four key contrasts between {POIs} before and during spindles and {KCs} versus the {NREM}2 core. Common increases were identified for all four subjects, especially within and close to the anterior cingulate cortex ({ACC}). These common increases were widespread for low frequencies, while for higher frequencies they were focal, confined to specific brain areas. For the pre-{KC} {POI}, only one prominent increase was identified, confined to the theta/alpha bands in a small area in the dorsal caudal part of {ACC} ({dcACC}). During {KCs}, the activity in this area grows in intensity and extent (in space and frequency), filling the space between the areas that expanded their low frequency activity (in the delta band) during {NREM}2 compared to {NREM}1. Our main finding is that prominent spectral power increases before {NREM}2 graphoelements are confined to the {dcACC}, and only for {KCs}, sharing common features with changes of activity in {dcACC} of the well-studied error related negativity ({ERN}). {ERN} is seen in awake state, in perceptual conflict and situations where there is a difference between expected and actual environmental or internal events. These results suggest that a {KC} is the sleep side of the awake state {ERN}, both serving their putative sentinel roles in the frame of the saliency network.},

	abstract = {Even modest sleep restriction, especially the loss of sleep slow wave activity ({SWA}), is invariably associated with slower electroencephalogram ({EEG}) activity during wake, the occurrence of local sleep in an otherwise awake brain, and impaired performance due to cognitive and memory deficits. Recent studies not only confirm the beneficial role of sleep in memory consolidation, but also point to a specific role for sleep slow waves. Thus, the implementation of methods to enhance sleep slow waves without unwanted arousals or lightening of sleep could have significant practical implications. Here we first review the evidence that it is possible to enhance sleep slow waves in humans using transcranial direct-current stimulation ({tDCS}) and transcranial magnetic stimulation. Since these methods are currently impractical and their safety is questionable, especially for chronic long-term exposure, we then discuss novel data suggesting that it is possible to enhance slow waves using sensory stimuli. We consider the physiology of the K-complex ({KC}), a peripheral evoked slow wave, and show that, among different sensory modalities, acoustic stimulation is the most effective in increasing the magnitude of slow waves, likely through the activation of non-lemniscal ascending pathways to the thalamo-cortical system. In addition, we discuss how intensity and frequency of the acoustic stimuli, as well as exact timing and pattern of stimulation, affect sleep enhancement. Finally, we discuss automated algorithms that read the {EEG} and, in real-time, adjust the stimulation parameters in a closed-loop manner to obtain an increase in sleep slow waves and avoid undesirable arousals. In conclusion, while discussing the mechanisms that underlie the generation of sleep slow waves, we review the converging evidence showing that acoustic stimulation is safe and represents an ideal tool for slow wave sleep ({SWS}) enhancement.},

Participants performed a cued recall in the evening after learning (160 word pairs) as well as in the subsequent morning after 8 hours of undisturbed sleep with full polysomnography. Overnight change in the number of recalled words, but not absolute memory performance, correlated significantly with increased spindle activity during the experimental night (r24 = .63, P {\textless} .01). Time spent in each sleep stage could not account for this relationship. Conclusion: A growing body of evidence supports the active role of sleep for information reprocessing.

This review summarizes the present knowledge on visually scored and automatically detected spindles, as well as the literature on {EEG} power in the sigma band. Among the factors known to affect sleep spindles and sigma activity, their intra-cycle temporal dynamics, their time-course across sleep cycles, the reciprocal relationship with delta activity, the effects of sleep deprivation, of circadian factors and of ageing, and their role in information processing have been discussed. Moreover, specific attention has been paid to the existence of functionally and topographically distinct slow- and fast-spindles, also taking into account the presence of large inter-individual differences.

	abstract = {Sleep spindles are extensively studied electroencephalographic rhythms that recur periodically during non-rapid eye movement sleep and that are associated with rhythmic discharges of neurons throughout the thalamocortical system. Their occurrence thus constrains many aspects of the communication between thalamus and cortex, ranging from sensory transmission, to cortical plasticity and learning, to development and disease. I review these functional aspects in conjunction with novel findings on the cellular and molecular makeup of spindle-pacemaking circuits. A highlight in the search of roles for sleep spindles is the repeated finding that spindles correlate with memory consolidation in humans and animals. By illustrating that spindles are at the forefront understanding on how the brain might benefit from sleep rhythms, I hope to stimulate further experimentation. © The Author(s) 2013.},

	abstract = {Study Objectives: Thalamo-cortical spindles driven by the up-state of neocortical slow ({\textless} 1 Hz) oscillations ({SOs}) represent a candidate mechanism of memory consolidation during sleep. We examined interactions between {SOs} and spindles in human slow wave sleep, focusing on the presumed existence of 2 kinds of spindles, i.e., slow frontocortical and fast centro-parietal spindles. Design: Two experiments were performed in healthy humans (24.5 ± 0.9 y) investigating undisturbed sleep (Experiment I) and the effects of prior learning (word paired associates) vs. non-learning (Experiment {II} ) on multichannel {EE} G recordings during sleep. Measurements and Results: Only fast spindles (12-15 Hz) were synchronized to the depolarizing {SO} up-state. Slow spindles (9-12 Hz) occurred preferentially at the transition into the {SO} down-state, i.e., during waning depolarization. Slow spindles also revealed a higher probability to follow rather than precede fast spindles. For sequences of individual {SOs}, fast spindle activity was largest for "initial" {SOs}, whereas {SO} amplitude and slow spindle activity were largest for succeeding {SOs}. Prior learning enhanced this pattern. Conclusions: The finding that fast and slow spindles occur at different times of the {SO} cycle points to disparate generating mechanisms for the 2 kinds of spindles. The reported temporal relationships during {SO} sequences suggest that fast spindles, driven by the {SO} up-state feed back to enhance the likelihood of succeeding {SOs} together with slow spindles. By enforcing such {SO}-spindle cycles, particularly after prior learning, fast spindles possibly play a key role in sleep-dependent memory processing.},

	abstract = {Sleep spindles are burstlike signals in the electroencephalogram ({EEG}) of the sleeping mammalian brain and electrical surface correlates of neuronal oscillations in thalamus. As one of the most inheritable sleep {EEG} signatures, sleep spindles probably reflect the strength and malleability of thalamocortical circuits that underlie individual cognitive profiles. We review the characteristics, organization, regulation, and origins of sleep spindles and their implication in non-rapid-eye-movement sleep ({NREMS}) and its functions, focusing on human and rodent. Spatially, sleep spindle-related neuronal activity appears on scales ranging from small thalamic circuits to functional cortical areas, and generates a cortical state favoring intracortical plasticity while limiting cortical output. Temporally, sleep spindles are discrete events, part of a continuous power band, and elements grouped on an infraslow time scale over which {NREMS} alternates between continuity and fragility. We synthesize diverse and seemingly unlinked functions of sleep spindles for sleep architecture, sensory processing, synaptic plasticity, memory formation, and cognitive abilities into a unifying sleep spindle concept, according to which sleep spindles 1) generate neural conditions of large-scale functional connectivity and plasticity that outlast their appearance as discrete {EEG} events, 2) appear preferentially in thalamic circuits engaged in learning and attention-based experience during wakefulness, and 3) enable a selective reactivation and routing of wake-instated neuronal traces between brain areas such as hippocampus and cortex. Their fine spatiotemporal organization reflects {NREMS} as a physiological state coordinated over brain and body and may indicate, if not anticipate and ultimately differentiate, pathologies in sleep and neurodevelopmental, -degenerative, and -psychiatric conditions.},

	abstract = {Summary Recently, the new American Academy of Sleep Medicine ({AASM}) rules and the old Rechtschaffen and Kales (R\&K) criteria for sleep scoring have been shown to produce significantly different results in adults. The aim of this study was to describe in detail such differences in a group of normal children. Polysomnographic recordings from 45 healthy children (18 females and 27 males) aged between 3 and 16 years were scored following both systems and the results compared. Several significant differences between the two scoring systems were found: N1 ({AASM}) was significantly higher than S1 (R\&K) while Stages N2 and R ({AASM}) were significantly smaller than S2 and rapid eye movement (R\&K). The Kendall τ correlation coefficient revealed a relatively low concordance between the two systems for the scoring of number of stage shifts per hour, minutes and percentage of Stage N1/S1, and of a percentage of Stage S2/N2. The significant differences between R\&K and {AASM} scoring systems suggest taking some caution in adopting the new scoring criteria in children; these might be shown to be potentially useful if careful selection of the appropriate indicators derived from this new method is carried out, such as the percentage of N1 and the number of stage shifts, which are measures very sensitive to the occurrence of arousals in the new {AASM} system. © 2009 European Sleep Research Society.},

	abstract = {The 1968 Rechtschaffen and Kales (R \& K) sleep scoring manual was published 15 years after {REM} sleep was discovered. Advances in the ensuing 28 years warranted a re-look at visual scoring of sleep stages. This paper describes the work of the {AASM} Visual Scoring Task Force, including methodology, a literature review and the rationale behind the new rules. Reliability studies of R \& K scoring were reviewed; reliability was low for stage one and moderate for slow wave sleep. Evidence indicated that K complexes and slow waves are expressed maximal frontally, spindles centrally and alpha rhythm over the occipital region. Three derivations of {EEG}, two of electro-oculography, and one of chin {EMG} were recommended. Scoring by 30-second epochs was retained. New terminology for sleep stages was proposed. Attenuation of alpha rhythm was determined to be the most valid electrophysiological marker of sleep onset. Alternative measures were proposed for non-alpha generating subjects. K complexes associated with arousals were determined to be insufficient alone to define the new stage N2. No evidence was found to justify dividing slow wave sleep into two stages. No reasons were found to alter the current slow wave amplitude criteria at any age. The phenomena of {REM} sleep were defined. The rules for defining onset and termination of {REM} sleep periods were simplified. Movement time was eliminated and major body movements defined. Studies are needed to test the reliability of the new rules. Future advances in technology may require modification of these rules with time.},

Anatomists have long considered it part of an extended limbic system based on its location posterior to the orbital frontal cortex and lateral to the amygdala, along with its tight connectivity to limbic and paralimbic regions. Here we review the literature in both non-human primates and humans to assess the temporal pole's putative role in social and emotional processing. Reviewed findings indicate that it has some role in both social and emotional processes, including face recognition and theory of mind, that goes beyond semantic memory. We propose that the temporal pole binds complex, highly processed perceptual inputs to visceral emotional responses. Because perceptual inputs remain segregated into dorsal (auditory), medial (olfactory) and ventral (visual) steams, the integration of emotion with perception is channel specific. © The Author (2007).

	abstract = {Behaviour is shaped by environmental challenge in the context of homoeostatic need. Emotional and cognitive processes evoke patterned changes in bodily state that may signal emotional state to others. This dynamic modulation of visceral state is neurally mediated by sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system. Moreover neural afferents convey representations of the internal state of the body back to the brain to further influence emotion and cognition. Neuroimaging and lesion studies implicate specific regions of limbic forebrain in the behavioural generation of autonomic arousal states. Activity within these regions may predict emotion-specific autonomic response patterns within and between bodily organs, with implications for psychosomatic medicine. Feedback from the viscera is mapped hierarchically in the brain to influence efferent signals, and ultimately at the cortical level to engender and reinforce affective responses and subjective feeling states. Again neuroimaging and patient studies suggest discrete neural substrates for these representations, notably regions of insula and orbitofrontal cortex. Individual differences in conscious access to these interoceptive representations predict differences in emotional experience, but equally the misperception of heightened arousal level may evoke changes in emotional behaviour through engagement of the same neural centres. Perturbation of feedback may impair emotional reactivity and, in the context of inflammatory states give rise to cognitive, affective and psychomotor expressions of illness. Changes in visceral state during emotion may be mirrored in the responses of others, permitting a corresponding representation in the observer. The degree to which individuals are susceptible to this 'contagion' predicts individual differences in questionnaire ratings of empathy. Together these neuroimaging and clinical studies highlight the dynamic relationship between mind and body and help identify neural substrates that may translate thoughts into autonomic arousal and bodily states into feelings that can be shared. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Ratings of positivity, negativity and arousal to picture stimuli (extending from very negative to very positive) were obtained. Lesions of the amygdala did not alter either positive or negative valence ratings, but were associated with attenuated arousal ratings for negative stimuli. In contrast, patients with insular lesions displayed reduced arousal to both negative and positive stimuli, as well as marked attenuation of corresponding valence ratings.

This influence can occur at multiple levels of operation, some of which occur consciously and some of which occur non-consciously. Here we review studies that confirm various predictions from the hypothesis. The orbitofrontal cortex represents one critical structure in a neural system sub-serving decision making. Decision making is not mediated by the orbitofrontal cortex alone, but arises from large-scale systems that include other cortical and subcortical components. Such structures include the amygdala, the somatosensory/insular cortices and the peripheral nervous system.

Attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder ({ADHD}) is accompanied by emotional deficits coincidently caused by dysfunctional interplay of fronto-limbic circuits. This study aimed to examine the role of sleep in the consolidation of emotional memory in {ADHD} in the context of healthy development. 16 children with {ADHD}, 16 healthy children, and 20 healthy adults participated in this study. Participants completed an emotional picture recognition paradigm in sleep and wake control conditions. Each condition had an immediate (baseline) and delayed (target) retrieval session. The emotional memory bias was baseline-corrected, and groups were compared in terms of sleep-dependent memory consolidation (sleep vs. wake). We observed an increased sleep-dependent emotional memory bias in healthy children compared to children with {ADHD} and healthy adults. Frontal oscillatory {EEG} activity (slow oscillations, theta) during sleep correlated negatively with emotional memory performance in children with {ADHD}. When combining data of healthy children and adults, correlation coefficients were positive and differed from those in children with {ADHD}. Since children displayed a higher frontal {EEG} activity than adults these data indicate a decline in sleep-related consolidation of emotional memory in healthy development. In addition, it is suggested that deficits in sleep-related selection between emotional and non-emotional memories in {ADHD} exacerbate emotional problems during daytime as they are often reported in {ADHD}. © 2013 Prehn-Kristensen, et al.},

	abstract = {After information is encoded into memory, it undergoes an off-line period of consolidation that may occur optimally during sleep. The consolidation process not only solidifies memories but also changes them in useful and adaptive ways. Here, we provide evidence for a shift in the neural structures used to retrieve emotional memories after a night of sleep compared to a day of wakefulness. Although the hippocampus was activated during successful retrieval of negative objects regardless of whether participants slept during a delay, sleep led to a shift from engagement of a diffuse memory retrieval network- including widespread activity in the lateral prefrontal and parietal cortices-to a more refined network of regions-including the amygdala and ventromedial {pFC}. Effective connectivity analyses revealed stronger connections among limbic regions after sleep versus wake. Although circadian effects may have contributed to these findings, our data strongly suggest that a night of sleep is sufficient to evoke qualitative changes in the emotional memory retrieval network. © 2011 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.},

	abstract = {Cognitive models propose a negative memory bias as one key factor contributing to the emergence and maintenance of social anxiety disorder ({SAD}). The long-term consolidation of memories relies on memory reactivations during sleep. We investigated in {SAD} patients and healthy controls the role of memory reactivations during sleep in the long-term consolidation of positive and negative information. Socially anxious and healthy children and adolescents learnt associations between pictures showing ambiguous situations and positive or negative words defining the situations’ outcome. Half of the words were re-presented during postlearning sleep (i.e., they were cued). Recall of picture–word associations and subjective ratings of pleasantness and arousal in response to the pictures was tested for cued and uncued stimuli. In the morning after cueing, cueing facilitated retention of positive and negative memories equally well in {SAD} patients and healthy controls. One week later, cueing led to reduced ratings of pleasantness of negative information in {SAD} but not in healthy controls. Coincidental to these findings was more pronounced {EEG} theta activity over frontal, temporal and parietal regions in response to negative stimuli in {SAD} patients. Our findings suggest that the preferential abstraction of negative emotional information during sleep might represent one factor underlying the negative memory bias in {SAD}.},

	abstract = {Emotional memories are preferentially consolidated during sleep, through the process of memory reactivation. Targeted memory reactivation ({TMR}) has been shown to boost memory consolidation during sleep, but its neural correlates remain unclear, particularly for emotional memories. Here, we aimed to examine how {TMR} of emotional material during slow wave sleep ({SWS}) impacts upon neural processing during a subsequent arousal rating task. Participants were trained on a spatial memory task including negative and neutral pictures paired with semantically matching sounds. The picture-sound pairs were rated for emotional arousal before and after the spatial memory task. Then, half of the sounds from each emotional category (negative and neutral) were cued during {SWS}. The next day, participants were retested on both the arousal rating and the spatial memory task inside an {MRI} scanner, followed by another retest session a week later. Memory consolidation and arousal processing did not differ between cued and non-cued items of either emotional category. We found increased responses to emotional stimuli in the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex ({OFC}), and a cueing versus emotion interaction in the {OFC}, whereby cueing neutral stimuli led to an increase in {OFC} activity, while cueing negative stimuli led to decreased {OFC} activation. Interestingly, the effect of cueing on amygdala activation was modulated by time spent in {REM} sleep. We conclude that {SWS} {TMR} impacts {OFC} activity, while {REM} sleep plays a role in mediating the effect of such cueing on amygdala.},

The {MNI} single-subject main sulci were first delineated and further used as landmarks for the 3D definition of 45 anatomical volumes of interest ({AVOI}) in each hemisphere. This procedure was performed using a dedicated software which allowed a 3D following of the sulci course on the edited brain. Regions of interest were then drawn manually with the same software every 2 mm on the axial slices of the high-resolution {MNI} single subject. The 90 {AVOI} were reconstructed and assigned a label. Using this parcellation method, three procedures to perform the automated anatomical labeling of functional studies are proposed: (1) labeling of an extremum defined by a set of coordinates, (2) percentage of voxels belonging to each of the {AVOI} intersected by a sphere centered by a set of coordinates, and (3) percentage of voxels belonging to each of the {AVOI} intersected by an activated cluster.

	abstract = {When an episode of emotional significance is encountered, it often results in the formation of a highly resistant memory representation that is easily retrieved for many succeeding years. Recent research shows that beyond generic consolidation processes, rapid eye movement ({REM}) sleep importantly contributes to this effect. However, the boundary conditions of consolidation processes during {REM} sleep, specifically whether these extend to source memory, have not been examined extensively. The current study tested the effects of putative consolidation processes emerging during {REM} sleep and slow wave sleep ({SWS}) on item and source memory of negative and neutral images, respectively. Results demonstrate superior emotional relative to neutral item memory retention after both late night {REM} sleep and early night {SWS}. Emotional source memory, on the other hand, exhibited an attenuated decline following late night {REM} sleep, whereas neutral source memory was selectively preserved across early night {SWS}. This pattern of results suggests a selective preservation of emotional source memory during {REM} sleep that is functionally dissociable from {SWS}-dependent reprocessing of neutral source memory. This was further substantiated by a neurophysiological dissociation: Postsleep emotional source memory was selectively correlated with frontal theta lateralization ({REM} sleep), whereas postsleep neutral item memory was correlated with {SWS} spindle power. As such, the present results contribute to a more comprehensive characterization of sleep-related consolidation mechanisms underlying emotional and neutral memory retention. Subsidiary analysis of emotional reactivity to previously encoded material revealed an enhancing rather than attenuating effect of late night {REM} sleep on emotional responses.},

Complementary to this, many scientists have called for plotting tools that accurately and transparently convey key aspects of statistical effects and raw data with minimal distortion. Previously common approaches, such as plotting conditional mean or median barplots together with error-bars have been criticized for distorting effect size, hiding underlying patterns in the raw data, and obscuring the assumptions upon which the most commonly used statistical tests are based. Here we describe a data visualization approach which overcomes these issues, providing maximal statistical information while preserving the desired ‘inference at a glance’ nature of barplots and other similar visualization devices. These “raincloud plots” can visualize raw data, probability density, and key summary statistics such as median, mean, and relevant confidence intervals in an appealing and flexible format with minimal redundancy.

	abstract = {Although the impact of sleep on cognitive function is increasingly well established, the role of sleep in modulating affective brain processes remains largely uncharacterized. Using a face recognition task, here we demonstrate an amplified reactivity to anger and fear emotions across the day, without sleep. However, an intervening nap blocked and even reversed this negative emotional reactivity to anger and fear while conversely enhancing ratings of positive (happy) expressions. Most interestingly, only those subjects who obtained rapid eye movement ({REM}) sleep displayed this remodulation of affective reactivity for the latter 2 emotion categories. Together, these results suggest that the evaluation of specific human emotions is not static across a daytime waking interval, showing a progressive reactivity toward threat-related negative expressions. However, an episode of sleep can reverse this predisposition, with {REM} sleep depotentiating negative reactivity toward fearful expressions while concomitantly facilitating recognition and ratings of reward-relevant positive expressions. These findings support the view that sleep, and specifically {REM} neurophysiology, may represent an important factor governing the optimal homeostasis of emotional brain regulation. © The Author 2010.

We employed behavioral and electrophysiological measures to investigate the short- and long-term impacts of sleep vs. sleep deprivation on emotional memory. Methods: Fifty-nine participants incidentally learned 60 negative and 60 neutral pictures in the evening and were randomly assigned to either sleep or sleep deprivation conditions. We measured memory recognition and subjective affective ratings in 12- and 60-h post-encoding tests, with {EEGs} in the delayed test. Results: In a 12-h post-encoding test, compared to sleep deprivation, sleep equally preserved both negative and neutral memory, and their affective tones. In the 60-h post-encoding test, negative and neutral memories declined significantly in the sleep group, with attenuated emotional responses to negative memories over time. Furthermore, two groups showed spatialorally distinguishable {ERPs} at the delayed test: while both groups showed the old-new frontal negativity (300-500 ms, {FN}400), sleep-deprived participants additionally showed an old-new parietal, Late Positive Component effect (600-1000 ms, {LPC}). Multivariate whole-brain {ERPs} analyses further suggested that sleep prioritized neural representation of emotion over memory processing, while they were less distinguishable in the sleep deprivation group. Conclusions: These data suggested that sleep's impact on emotional memory and affective responses is time-dependent: sleep preserved memories and affective tones in the short term, while ameliorating affective tones in the long term. Univariate and multivariate {EEG} analyses revealed different neurocognitive processing of remote, emotional memories between sleep and sleep deprivation groups.},

Moreover, little is known about the link between emotional reactivity at the time of encoding and subsequent sleep-based emotional memory consolidation. This study examined whether sleep would potentiate, protect, or depotentiate measures of heart rate and skin conductance in response to scenes containing emotional and neutral objects, and assessed how these measures of reactivity would predict subsequent memory for the objects across delays of sleep and wake. Heart rate deceleration ({HRD}) and skin conductance response ({SCR}) data were collected at encoding and recognition. Although {HRD} and {SCR} reactivity to objects were depotentiated after a sleep-filled delay, they remained unchanged after a delay containing wakefulness. Moreover, increased arousal responses to negative scenes at encoding as measured by {HRD} and {SCR} responses were positively correlated with subsequent memory for the negative objects of scenes, but only in the sleep group. This suggests that larger reactions to negative images at the time of encoding set the stage for the preferential consolidation of these images during a night of sleep. Although arousal responses are often thought to account for emotional enhancement in long-term memory, these findings suggest that both an arousal response at encoding and a subsequent period of sleep are needed to optimize selective emotional memory consolidation. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

During all sessions, emotional responses as measured by subjective ratings, the late positive potential of the {EEG} ({LPP}) and heart rate deceleration ({HRD}) were recorded.

We used an emotional memory task to assess whether poor sleep quality, as well as sleep deprivation, may influence the accuracy of memory recognition, but also the affective tone associated with the memory. Methods: Seventy-five subjects, divided into poor sleeper ({PS}), good sleeper ({GS}), and sleep deprivation ({SD}) groups, completed two recall (R) sessions: R1, 1 h after the encoding phase; and R2, after one night of sleep for {PS} and {GS} groups and after one night of sleep deprivation for the {SD} group. During the encoding phase, the participants rated valence and arousal of 90 pictures. During R1 and R2, the participants first made a yes/no memory judgment of the 45 target pictures intermingled with 30 non-target pictures, then rated valence and arousal of each picture. Results: Recognition accuracy was higher for the {PS} and {GS} groups compared to the {SD} group for all pictures. Emotional valence of the remembered pictures was more negative after sleep deprivation and poor quality sleep, while it was preserved after a good sleep. Conclusions: These results provide the first evidence that poor sleep quality negatively affects emotional valence of memories, within the context of preserved emotional memory consolidation. It is suggested that low sleep quality and lack of sleep may impose a more negative affective tone to memories. The reported effects are not to be ascribed to depressive mood, but to a specific influence of poor sleep quality.},

In the current study, young and middle-aged adults viewed negative and neutral pictures and underwent a recognition test after sleep or wake. Subjective emotional reactivity was also measured.

	abstract = {The orbitofrontal cortex represents the reward or affective value of primary reinforcers including taste, touch, texture, and face expression. It learns to associate other stimuli with these to produce representations of the expected reward value for visual, auditory, and abstract stimuli including monetary reward value. The orbitofrontal cortex thus plays a key role in emotion, by representing the reward value of the goals for action. The learning process is stimulus-reinforcer association learning. Negative reward prediction error neurons are related to this affective learning. Activations in the orbitofrontal cortex correlate with the subjective emotional experience of affective stimuli, and damage to the orbitofrontal cortex impairs emotion-related learning, emotional behaviour, and subjective affective state. Top-down attention to affect modulates orbitofrontal cortex representations, and attention to intensity modulates representations in earlier cortical areas that represent the physical properties of stimuli. Top-down word-level cognitive inputs can bias affective representations in the orbitofrontal cortex, providing a mechanism for cognition to influence emotion. Whereas the orbitofrontal cortex provides a representation of reward or affective value on a continuous scale, areas beyond the orbitofrontal cortex such as the medial prefrontal cortex area 10 are involved in binary decision-making when a choice must be made. For this decision-making, the orbitofrontal cortex provides a representation of the value of each specific reward on the same scale, with no conversion to a common currency. Increased activity in a lateral orbitofrontal cortex non-reward area provides a new attractor-related approach to understanding and treating depression. Consistent with the theory, the lateral orbitofrontal cortex has increased functional connectivity in depression, and the medial orbitofrontal cortex, involved in reward, has decreased functional connectivity in depression.},

Considering antimicrobial resistance, we investigated the impact of the apparent intracellular H. pylori ({aiHp}) on treatment failure of first-line triple therapies. Methods: Gastric biopsies of 814 H. pylori infected patients naïve for treatment were analyzed before and after eradication therapy by immunohistochemistry. Thereof, 373 received treatment consisting of amoxicillin, clarithromycin and {PPI} ({AC}/{PPI}). Availability of {PCR}-based clarithromycin susceptibility test results from pre-treatment gastric biopsies was a pre-condition for matching 52 {aiHp} to 52 non-{aiHp} cases within the {AC}/{PPI}-group. Results: {AiHp} were detected mostly in low counts predominantly in corpus, rarely in antrum biopsies (95.2\% vs. 24.6\%); they were found in 497 (61\%) of all patients and in 192 of 373 patients (51.5\%) in the {AC}/{PPI}-group.

Both {aiHp} and resistance to clarithromycin proved to be highly significant (p≤0.001) and independent predictors of eradication failure. Twelve of 13 {aiHp} cases with a clarithromycin sensitive strain, who failed eradication, developed resistance to the antibiotic. Conclusions: {AiHp} found by immunohistochemical staining especially in corpus biopsies proved to be a risk factor for failure of first-line triple therapies; occurrence of {aiHp} should be considered with regard to therapy options.},

Participants provided affective ratings for negative and neutral images while heart rate deceleration ({HRD}) and skin conductance responses ({SCRs}) were monitored. Following a 12-hour delay of sleep or wakefulness, participants completed an image recognition task where {HRD}, {SCRs} and affective ratings were recorded again. {HRD} responses to previously-encoded (“old”) negative images were preserved after sleep but diminished after wakefulness. No between-group difference in {HRD} was observed for novel negative images at recognition, indicating that the effects of sleep for old images were not driven by a generalised overnight increase in visceral activity, or circadian factors. No significant effects of sleep were observed for {SCRs} or subjective ratings. Our data suggest that cardiac arousal experienced at the time of encoding is sensitive to plasticity-promoting processes during sleep in a similar manner to episodic aspects of emotional memory.},

In this study we tested the influence of memory reactivation during rapid eye movement ({REM}) sleep on memory performance and brain responses at retrieval in healthy human participants. Participants: Fifty-six healthy subjects (28 women and 28 men, age [mean ± standard deviation]: 21.6 ± 2.2 y) participated in this functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) study. Methods and Results: Auditory cues were associated with pictures of faces during their encoding. These memory cues delivered during {REM} sleep enhanced subsequent accurate recollections but also false recognitions. These results suggest that reactivated memories interacted with semantically related representations, and induced new creative associations, which subsequently reduced the distinction between new and previously encoded exemplars. Cues had no effect if presented during stage 2 sleep, or if they were not associated with faces during encoding. Functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed that following exposure to conditioned cues during {REM} sleep, responses to faces during retrieval were enhanced both in a visual area and in a cortical region of multisensory (auditory-visual) convergence. Conclusions: These results show that reactivating memories during {REM} sleep enhances cortical responses during retrieval, suggesting the integration of recent memories within cortical circuits, favoring the generalization and schematization of the information.},

	abstract = {Emotional memories are reprocessed during sleep, and it is widely assumed that this reprocessing occurs mainly during rapid eye movement ({REM}) sleep. In support for this notion, vivid emotional dreams occur mainly during {REM} sleep, and several studies have reported emotional memory enhancement to be associated with {REM} sleep or {REM} sleep-related parameters. However, it is still unknown whether reactivation of emotional memories during {REM} sleep strengthens emotional memories. Here, we tested whether re-presentation of emotionally learned stimuli during {REM} sleep enhances emotional memory. In a split-night design, participants underwent Pavlovian conditioning after the first half of the night. Neutral sounds served as conditioned stimuli ({CS}) and were either paired with a negative odor ({CS}+) or an odorless vehicle ({CS}-). During sound replay in subsequent late {REM} or N2 sleep, half of the {CS}+ and half of the {CS}- were presented again. In contrast to our hypothesis, replay during sleep did not affect emotional memory as measured by the differentiation between {CS}+ and {CS}- in expectancy, arousal and valence ratings. However, replay unspecifically decreased subjective arousal ratings of both emotional and neutral sounds and increased positive valence ratings also for both {CS}+ and {CS}- sounds, respectively. These effects were slightly more pronounced for replay during {REM} sleep. Our results suggest that re-exposure to previously conditioned stimuli during late sleep does not affect emotional memory strength, but rather influences the affective tone of both emotional and neutral memories.},

We investigated the evolution of memory for negative scenes across 30 min, 12 daytime hours spent awake, and 12 nighttime hours including sleep. After 30 min, negative objects were well remembered at the expense of information about their backgrounds. Time spent awake led to forgetting of the entire negative scene, with memories of objects and their backgrounds decaying at similar rates. Sleep, in contrast, led to a preservation of memories of negative objects, but not their backgrounds, a result suggesting that the two components undergo differential processing during sleep. Memory for a negative scene develops differentially across time delays containing sleep and wake, with sleep selectively consolidating those aspects of memory that are of greatest value to the organism.

	abstract = {While non-{REM} ({NREM}) sleep has been strongly implicated in the reactivation and consolidation of memory traces, the role of rapid-eye movement ({REM}) sleep remains unclear. A growing body of research on humans and animals provide behavioral evidence for a role of {REM} sleep in the strengthening and modulation of emotional memories. Theta activity-which describes low frequency oscillations in the local field potential within the hippocampus, amygdala and neocortex-is a prominent feature of both wake and {REM} sleep in humans and rodents. Theta coherence between the hippocampus and amygdala drives large-scale pontine-geniculo-occipital ({PGO}) waves, the density of which predicts increases in plasticity-related gene expression. This could potentially facilitate the processing of emotional memory traces within the hippocampus during {REM} sleep. Further, the timing of hippocampal activity in relation to theta phase is vital in determining subsequent potentiation of neuronal activity. This could allow the emotionally modulated strengthening of novel and gradual weakening of consolidated hippocampal memory traces during {REM} sleep. Hippocampal theta activity is also correlated with {REM} sleep levels of achetylcholine - which is thought to reduce hippocampal inputs in the neocortex. The additional low levels of noradrenaline during {REM} sleep, which facilitate feedback within the neocortex, could allow the integration of novel memory traces previously consolidated during {NREM} sleep. We therefore propose that {REM} sleep mediates the prioritized processing of emotional memories within the hippocampus, the integration of previously consolidated memory traces within the neocortex, as well as the disengagement of consolidated neocortical memory traces from the hippocampus.},

To examine whether this integrative function of amygdalo-hippocampal structures extends to the human brain, we tested unilateral-temporal-lobectomy patients on an adaptation of a classic paradigm in which levels of physiological arousal at encoding modulate retention over time. Subjects rated emotionally arousing (taboo) and neutral words on an arousal scale while their skin conductance responses ({SCRs}) were monitored. Recall for the words was assessed immediately and after a 1-hr delay. Both temporal-lobectomy patients and control subjects generated enhanced {SCRs} and arousal ratings for the arousing words at the time of encoding. However, only control subjects exhibited an increase in memory for the arousing words over time. This group difference in the effect of arousal on the rate of forgetting suggests that the role of medial temporal lobe structures in memory consolidation for arousing events is conserved across species.},

However, this increase in memory for emotional objects corresponded with a decrease in memory for the neutral backgrounds on which these objects were placed.

Here, we examined the effects of slow wave sleep ({SWS}) and {REM} sleep on the consolidation of emotionally negative and neutral item (picture recognition) and source memory (recall of picture-location and picture-frame color association) in humans. In Study 1, the participants (n= 18) learned 48 negative and 48 neutral pictures which were presented at specific locations and preceded by colored frames that had to be associated with the picture. In a within-subject design, learning was either followed by a 3-h early-night {SWS}-rich or by a late-night {REM} sleep-rich retention interval, then retrieval was tested. Only after {REM}-rich sleep, and not after {SWS}-rich sleep, was there a significant emotional enhancement, i.e., a significantly superior retention of emotional over neutral pictures. On the other hand, after {SWS}-rich sleep the retention of picture-frame color associations was better than after {REM}-rich sleep. However, this benefit was observed only for neutral pictures; and it was completely absent for the emotional pictures. To examine whether this absent benefit reflected a suppressive effect of emotionality on associations of minor task relevance, in Study 2 we manipulated the relevance of the picture-frame color association by combining it with information about monetary reward, following otherwise comparable procedures. Here, rewarded picture-frame color associations were equally well retained over {SWS}-rich early sleep no matter if the frames were associated with emotional or neutral pictures. Results are consistent with the view that {REM} sleep favors the emotional enhancement of item memory whereas {SWS} appears to contribute primarily to the consolidation of context-color information associated with the item.},

Two groups of men were tested across 3-h periods of early and late sleep (sleep group) or corresponding retention intervals filled with wakefulness (wake group). Sleep was recorded polysomnographically. Cortisol concentrations in saliva were monitored at acquisition and retrieval testing.

Sleep improved retention, compared with the effects of wake intervals (P {\textless} 0.02). However, this effect was substantial only in the late night (P {\textless} 0.005), during which retention was generally worse than during the early night (P {\textless} 0.02).

Selective sleep effects were observed for consolidation of emotional memory: Recognition accuracy for know judgments of arousing stimuli improved by 42\% after sleep relative to wake, and recognition bias for remember judgments of these stimuli increased by 58\% after sleep relative to wake (resulting in more conservative responding). These findings hold important implications for understanding of human memory processing, suggesting that the facilitation of memory for emotionally salient information may preferentially develop during sleep.

This process is thought to rely on the spontaneous reactivation of emotional memories during sleep, though it is still unclear which sleep stage is optimal for such reactivation. We examined this question by explicitly manipulating memory reactivation in both rapid-eye movement sleep ({REM}) and slow-wave sleep ({SWS}) using targeted memory reactivation ({TMR}) and testing the impact of this manipulation on habituation of subjective arousal responses across a night. Our results show that {TMR} during {REM}, but not {SWS} significantly decreased subjective arousal, and this effect is driven by the more negative stimuli. These results support one aspect of the sleep to forget, sleep to remember ({SFSR}) hypothesis which proposes that emotional memory reactivation during {REM} sleep underlies sleep-dependent habituation.},

However, its exact contribution and, specifically, whether its effect is mainly on the consolidation of the contents or the processing of the affective component of emotional memories is not clear. Here, we investigated the effects of sleep rich in slow wave sleep ({SWS}) or {REM} sleep on the consolidation of emotional pictures and the accompanying changes in affective tone, using event-related potentials ({ERPs}) together with subjective ratings of valence and arousal. Sixteen healthy, young men learned 50 negative and 50 neutral pictures before 3-h retention sleep intervals that were filled with either {SWS}-rich early or {REM} sleep-rich late nocturnal sleep. In accordance with our hypothesis, recognition was better for emotional pictures than neutral pictures after {REM} compared to {SWS}-rich sleep. This emotional enhancement after {REM}-rich sleep expressed itself in an increased late positive potential of the {ERP} over the frontal cortex 300-500. ms after stimulus onset for correctly classified old emotional pictures compared with new emotional and neutral pictures. Valence and arousal ratings of emotional pictures were not differentially affected by {REM} or {SWS}-rich sleep after learning. Our results corroborate that {REM} sleep contributes to the consolidation of emotional contents in memory, but suggest that the affective tone is preserved rather than reduced by the processing of emotional memories during {REM} sleep. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

Specifically, these experiments show that declarative memory benefits mainly from sleep periods dominated by {SWS}, whereas there is no consistent benefit of this memory from periods rich in rapid eye movement [{REM}] sleep. A main mechanism of declarative memory formation is believed to be the reactivation of newly acquired memory representations in hippocampal networks that stimulates a transfer and integration of these representations into neocortical neuronal networks. Consistent with this model, spindle activity and slow oscillation-related {EEG} coherence increase during early sleep after intense declarative learning in humans, signs that together point toward a neocortical reprocessing of the learned material. In addition, sleep seems to provide an optimal milieu for declarative memory reprocessing and consolidation by reducing cholinergic activation and the cortisol feedback to the hippocampus during {SWS}.},

	abstract = {Functional brain imaging has been used in humans to noninvasively investigate the neural mechanisms underlying the generation of sleep stages. On the one hand, {REM} sleep has been associated with the activation of the pons, thalamus, limbic areas, and temporo-occipital cortices, and the deactivation of prefrontal areas, in line with theories of {REM} sleep generation and dreaming properties. On the other hand, during non-{REM} ({NREM}) sleep, decreases in brain activity have been consistently found in the brainstem, thalamus, and in several cortical areas including the medial prefrontal cortex ({MPFC}), in agreement with a homeostatic need for brain energy recovery. Benefiting from a better temporal resolution, more recent studies have characterized the brain activations related to phasic events within specific sleep stages. In particular, they have demonstrated that {NREM} sleep oscillations (spindles and slow waves) are indeed associated with increases in brain activity in specific subcortical and cortical areas involved in the generation or modulation of these waves. These data highlight that, even during {NREM} sleep, brain activity is increased, yet regionally specific and transient. Besides refining the understanding of sleep mechanisms, functional brain imaging has also advanced the description of the functional properties of sleep. For instance, it has been shown that the sleeping brain is still able to process external information and even detect the pertinence of its content. The relationship between sleep and memory has also been refined using neuroimaging, demonstrating post-learning reactivation during sleep, as well as the reorganization of memory representation on the systems level, sometimes with long-lasting effects on subsequent memory performance. Further imaging studies should focus on clarifying the role of specific sleep patterns for the processing of external stimuli, as well as the consolidation of freshly encoded information during sleep.},

A control experiment during which subjects made self-paced saccades in total darkness showed no activation in the visual cortex. The {REM}-related activation of the primary visual cortex without visual input from the retina provides neural evidence for the existence of human ponto-geniculo-occipital waves ({PGO} waves) and a link between {REMs} and dreaming. Furthermore, the time-course analysis of blood oxygenation level-dependent responses indicated that the activation of the pontine tegmentum, ventroposterior thalamus and primary visual cortex started before the occurrence of {REMs}. On the other hand, the activation of the putamen and limbic areas accompanied {REMs}. The activation of the parahippocampal gyrus and amygdala simultaneously with {REMs} suggests that {REMs} and/or their generating mechanism are not merely an epiphenomenon of {PGO} waves, but may be linked to the triggering activation of these areas.},

We investigated these questions in eight subjects with unilateral amygdala damage, using several different measures. For comparison, our main task used stimuli identical to those used previously to investigate emotional declarative memory in patients with bilateral amygdala damage. Contrasts with both brain-damaged and normal control groups showed that subjects with left amygdala damage were impaired in their memory for emotional stimuli, despite entirely normal memory for neutral stimuli (because of a number of caveats, the findings from subjects with right amygdala damage were less clear). Follow-up experiments suggested that the normal facilitation of memory for emotional stimuli may develop over an extended time course ({\textgreater}30 min), consistent with prior findings, and that the specific impairment we report may depend in part on the lexical nature of the task used (written questionnaire).

These investigations have typically aimed to either characterize the contributions of the amygdala and medial temporal lobe ({MTL}) memory system, replicating results in animals, or delineate the neural correlates of specific behavioral phenomena. It has remained difficult, however, to synthesize these findings into a systems neuroscience account of how networks across the whole-brain support the enhancing effects of emotion on memory encoding. To this end, the present study employed a meta-analytic approach using activation likelihood estimates to assess the anatomical specificity and reliability of event-related {fMRI} activations related to successful memory encoding for emotional versus neutral information. The meta-analysis revealed consistent clusters within bilateral amygdala, anterior hippocampus, anterior and posterior parahippocampal gyrus, the ventral visual stream, left lateral prefrontal cortex and right ventral parietal cortex. The results within the amygdala and {MTL} support a wealth of findings from the animal literature linking these regions to arousal-mediated memory effects. The consistency of findings in cortical targets, including the visual, prefrontal, and parietal cortices, underscores the importance of generating hypotheses regarding their participation in emotional memory formation. In particular, we propose that the amygdala interacts with these structures to promote enhancements in perceptual processing, semantic elaboration, and attention, which serve to benefit subsequent memory for emotional material. These findings may motivate future research on emotional modulation of widespread neural systems and the implications of this modulation for cognition. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

To elucidate the neural mechanisms carrying reactivation-related mnemonic information, we investigated whether content-specific memory signatures associated with memory reactivation during wakefulness reoccur during subsequent sleep. We show that theta oscillations orchestrate the reactivation of memories during both wakefulness and sleep. Reactivation patterns during sleep autonomously re-emerged at a rate of ∼1 Hz, indicating a coordination by slow oscillatory activity. Schreiner et al. show that cue-triggered memory reactivation shares the same neural signatures during wakefulness and sleep. Theta oscillations orchestrate the reactivation of memories during both physiological states.

However, the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying such visual fixation in creative cognition are unclear. In the present experiment, we explored whether example images impacted creative imagination and patterns of neural activity within brain regions associated with visual object recognition. Participants first viewed example images (ambiguous line drawings) accompanied by high-constraint and low-constraint labels. High-constraint labels resembled the line drawings, whereas low constraint labels did not. Next, participants imagined new labels for the same line drawings, with the initial labels removed. Consistent with our predictions, semantic distance analysis comparing cue labels to newly generated labels showed lower average semantic distance (i.e., less creative ideas) on high-constraint trials compared to low-constraint trials. Using representational similarity analysis, we also demonstrated that neural pattern similarity was anticorrelated (less similar) from object recognition to high-constraint imagination trials within the right inferior temporal gyrus, right middle temporal gyrus, and right superior occipital gyrus. Broadly, these findings suggest that salient visual examples may guide the formation of strong mental representations that constrain creative imagination. This research also offers a first step toward identifying neurocognitive signatures associated with the effortful process of producing new, creative ideas following exposure to fixating examples–particularly at the early level of object recognition/representation in the ventral visual stream.},

	abstract = {Study Objectives: This study examined the effects of bright light exposure, as compared to dim light, on daytime subjective sleepiness, incidences of slow eye movements ({SEMs}), and psychomotor vigilance task ({PVT}) performance following 2 nights of sleep restriction. Design: The study had a mixed factorial design with 2 independent variables: light condition (bright light, 1,000 lux; dim light, {\textless} 5 lux) and time of day. The dependent variables were subjective sleepiness, {PVT} performance, incidences of {SEMs}, and salivary melatonin levels. Setting: Sleep research laboratory at Monash University. Participants: Sixteen healthy adults (10 women and 6 men) aged 18 to 35 years (mean age 25 years, 3 months). Interventions: Following 2 nights of sleep restriction (5 hours each night), participants were exposed to modified constant routine conditions. Eight participants were exposed to bright light from noon until 5:00 pm. Outside the bright light exposure period (9:00 am to noon, 5:00 pm to 9:00 pm) light levels were maintained at less than 5 lux. A second group of 8 participants served as controls for the bright light exposure and were exposed to dim light throughout the entire protocol Measurements and Results: Bright light exposure reduced subjective sleepiness, decreased {SEMs}, and improved {PVT} performance compared to dim light. Bright lights had no effect on salivary melatonin. A significant positive correlation between {PVT} reaction times and subjective sleepiness was observed for both groups. Changes in {SEMs} did not correlate significantly with either subjective sleepiness or {PVT} performance. Conclusions: Daytime bright light exposure can reduce the impact of sleep loss on sleepiness levels and performance, as compared to dim light. These effects appear to be mediated by mechanisms that are separate from melatonin suppression. The results may assist in the development of treatments for daytime sleepiness.},

However, modern life and work styles have led to much more time spent indoors, often with lower daytime and higher evening/nighttime light intensity from electrical lighting than outdoors. Whether this has long-term consequences for human health is being currently investigated. We tested if bright blue-enriched morning light over several days could counteract the detrimental effects of inadequate daytime and evening lighting. In a seminaturalistic, within-between subject study design, 18 young participants were exposed to different lighting conditions on 3 evenings (blue-enriched, bright orange, or dim light), after exposure to 2 lighting conditions (mixed blue-enriched light and control light, for 3 days each) in the mornings. Subjective sleepiness, reaction times, salivary melatonin concentrations, and nighttime sleep were assessed. Exposure to the blue-enriched morning lighting showed acute wake-promoting effects and faster reaction times than with control lighting. Some of these effects persisted until the evening, and performance improved over several days. The magnitude of circadian phase shifts induced by combinations of 3 different evening and 2 morning lighting conditions were significantly smaller with the blue-enriched morning light. During the night, participants had longer total sleep times after orange light exposure than after blue light exposure in the evening. Our results indicate that bright blue-enriched morning light stabilizes circadian phase, and it could be an effective counterstrategy for poor lighting during the day and also light exposure at the wrong time, such as in the late evening.},

Alertness, cognition and mood were assessed throughout the night and following morning. Five women and 13 men (mean 24.78 year old) presented with a progressive and increasing alteration of alertness, cognition, and mood during each sleep deprivation. A rebound was observed at 8 am resulting from the circadian drive overriding cumulative sleep homeostatic effects. Morning light significantly improved sleepiness and sustained attention from 5 to 7 am. These effects were comparable between devices and significantly different from control. Both devices were overall well and similarly tolerated. Early morning light therapy in the condition of sleep loss may have broad practical applications to improve sleepiness, sustained attention and subsequent risk of accidents.},

	abstract = {The waking brain efficiently detects emotional signals to promote survival. However, emotion detection during sleep is poorly understood and may be influenced by individual sleep characteristics or neural reactivity. Notably, dream recall frequency has been associated with stimulus reactivity during sleep, with enhanced stimulus-driven responses in high vs. low recallers. Using electroencephalography ({EEG}), we characterized the neural responses of healthy individuals to emotional, neutral voices, and control stimuli, both during wakefulness and {NREM} sleep. Then, we tested how these responses varied with individual dream recall frequency. Event-related potentials ({ERPs}) differed for emotional vs. neutral voices, both in wakefulness and {NREM}. Likewise, {EEG} arousals (sleep perturbations) increased selectively after the emotional voices, indicating emotion reactivity. Interestingly, sleep {ERP} amplitude and arousals after emotional voices increased linearly with participants’ dream recall frequency. Similar correlations with dream recall were observed for beta and sigma responses, but not for theta. In contrast, dream recall correlations were absent for neutral or control stimuli. Our results reveal that brain reactivity to affective salience is preserved during {NREM} and is selectively associated to individual memory for dreams. Our findings also suggest that emotion-specific reactivity during sleep, and not generalized alertness, may contribute to the encoding/retrieval of dreams.},

	doi = {10.31234/osf.io/ag5q9},
	abstract = {Researchers have been studying creativity for decades, and yet controversy still surrounds the cognitive basis of creative thought. A longstanding question in the creativity literature concerns the role of memory in creative cognition. Increasing evidence suggests that specific memory systems (e.g., episodic vs. semantic) may support specific creative thought processes. However, a number of inconsistencies in the literature remain with respect to the strength and direction of the relationship between memory and creativity, and key questions persist concerning the influence of specific memory types (semantic, episodic, working, and short-term) and creativity (divergent and convergent thinking) as well as external factors (age, stimuli modality) on this purported relationship. In this meta-analysis, we examined 525 correlations from 79 published studies and unpublished datasets, representing data from 12,846 individual participants. We found a small but significant (r = .19) correlation between memory and creative cognition. Among semantic, episodic, working, and short-term memory, semantic memory—particularly verbal fluency, the ability to strategically retrieve information from long-term memory—was found to drive this relationship. Further, working memory capacity was found to be more strongly related to convergent than divergent creative thinking. We also found that within visual creativity, the relationship with visual memory was greater than that of verbal memory, but within verbal creativity, the relationship with verbal memory was greater than that of visual memory. Finally, there was no overall impact of age on the overall effect size, though the memory-creativity correlation was larger for children compared to young adults. These results help to resolve over a half century of research on memory and creativity, with three key conclusions: 1) semantic memory supports both verbal and nonverbal creative thinking, 2) working memory supports convergent creative thinking, and 3) the cognitive control of memory is central to performance on creative thinking tasks.},

Here, we investigate spontaneous memory reprocessing during sleep by applying machine learning to source space-transformed magnetoencephalographic data in a two-step exploratory and confirmatory study design. We decode memory-related activity from slow oscillations in hippocampus, frontal cortex and precuneus, indicating parallel memory processing during sleep. Moreover, we show complementary roles of hippocampus and neocortex: while gamma activity indicated memory reprocessing in hippocampus, delta and theta frequencies allowed decoding of memory in neocortex. Neocortex and hippocampus were linked through coherent activity and modulation of high-frequency gamma oscillations by theta, a dynamic similar to memory processing during wakefulness. Overall, we noninvasively demonstrate localized, coordinated memory reprocessing in human sleep.},

We examined this first by reviewing the literature focusing on sleep/wake contrasts, and then the literature on whether any specific factors during sleep preferentially benefit emotional memories, with a special focus on the often-suggested claim that rapid eye movement sleep primarily consolidates emotional memories. A second aim was to examine if sleep preferentially benefits memories based on other cues of future relevance such as reward, test-expectancy or different instructions during encoding. Once again, we first focused on studies comparing sleep and wake groups, and then on studies examining the contributions of specific factors during sleep (for each future relevance paradigm, respectively). The review revealed that although some support exists that sleep is more beneficial for certain kinds of memories based on emotion or other cues of future relevance, the majority of studies does not support such an effect. Regarding specific factors during sleep, our review revealed that no sleep variable has reliably been found to be specifically associated with the consolidation of certain kinds of memories over others based on emotion or other cues of future relevance.},

	abstract = {Sleep benefits the long-term preservation of emotional memories, making them accessible even years after the emotional episode has occurred. However, whether sleep also influences the emotional response that gets elicited while retrieving such memories (e.g., by increasing autonomic activity) remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that sleep fosters a coherent decrease in both automatic (heart rate deceleration) and more cognitively controlled subjective measures (valence ratings) of the emotional tone associated with memories when they are retrieved after one week. Exploratory analyses suggest that sleep might initiate an enhancement of the neural representation of emotional compared to neutral memories (as reflected in the late positive potential of the electroencephalogram) that becomes pronounced after one week. These long-term effects are in contrast to sleep's immediate influence on the emotional response (i.e., 10 h after encoding), where heart rate deceleration was preserved and the late positive potential decreased when compared to the changes seen over a day of wake. Together, these results suggest that sleeping after an emotional experience has dynamic and protracted influences on the emotional tone associated with memories.},

We investigated long-term effects of sleep on typical memory tasks. During the hours following learning, participants slept or stayed awake. We compared recall performance between wake and sleep conditions after delays of up to 6 days. Performance develops in two distinct ways. Word pair, syllable, and motor sequence learning tasks benefit from sleep during the first day after encoding, when compared with daytime or nighttime wakefulness. However, performance in the wake conditions recovers after another night of sleep, so that we observe no lasting effect of sleep. Sleep deprivation before recall does not impair performance. Thus, fatigue cannot adequately explain the lack of long-term effects. We suggest that the hippocampus might serve as a buffer during the retention interval, and consolidation occurs during delayed sleep. In contrast, a non-hippocampal mirror-tracing task benefits significantly from sleep, even when tested after a 4-day delay including recovery sleep. This indicates a dissociation between two sleep-related consolidation mechanisms, which could rely on distinct neuronal processes.},

	doi = {10.1038/nn.3303.Sleep-dependent},
	abstract = {The brain does not retain all the information it encodes in a day. Much is forgotten, and of those memories retained, their subsequent "evolution" can follow any of a number of pathways. Emerging data makes clear that sleep is a compelling candidate for performing many of these operations. But how does the sleeping brain know which information to preserve and which to forget? What should sleep do with that information it chooses to keep? For information that is retained, sleep can integrate it into existing memory networks, look for common patterns and distill overarching rules, or simply stabilize and strengthen the memory exactly as it was learned. We suggest such "memory triage" lies at the heart of a sleep-dependent memory processing system that selects new information, in a discriminatory manner, and assimilates it into the brain's vast armamentarium of evolving knowledge, helping guide each organism through its own, unique life. In this perspective piece, we outline evidence supporting the concept of evolving knowledge through a process of "memory triage" that first identifies which memories should go through sleep-dependent memory processing, and then determines the form that this processing should take. The model adds to earlier conceptions of sleep-dependent consolidation in several ways. First, it shifts the description away from one of uniform memory consolidation toward a complex offline process that is remarkably selective in terms of which memories are consolidated by sleep, leading to the discriminatory incorporation of initially pluripotent memories. Second, it describes a further stage in this triage process, which directs a given memory through one of several pathways of memory evolution. Such evolution leads to multiple forms of integrated knowledge, potentially governed by a range of neural systems, and facilitated by varied stages of sleep. Finally, it favors a view of consolidation not as an end-goal, but as a stepping-stone along a path that leads to the building and updating of generalized knowledge and beliefs about the world in which we live and act. We start from a position that assumes the existence of sleep-dependent memory processing. Not withstanding the limitations of some experimental paradigms that require careful controls (e.g. for time of day or non-specific effects of sleep deprivation), when taken as a whole, evidence to date from (i) nap studies (that match circadian time concerns), (ii) sleep deprivation studies (with delayed retests), (iii) studies finding correlations of offline memory},

The electroencephalogram of patients shows focal interictal epileptic spikes, particularly during non-rapid eye movement ({NonREM}) sleep. Spike formation involves thalamocortical networks, which also contribute to the generation of sleep slow oscillations ({SOs}) and spindles. Motivated by evidence that {SO}-spindle activity can be controlled through closed-loop auditory stimulation, here, we show in seven patients that auditory stimulation also reduces spike rates in {BECTS}. Stimulation during {NonREM} sleep decreases spike rates, with most robust reductions when tones are presented 1.5 to 3.5 s after spikes. Stimulation further reduces the amplitude of spikes closely following tones. Sleep spindles are negatively correlated with spike rates, suggesting that tone-evoked spindle activity mediates the spike suppression. We hypothesize spindle-related refractoriness in thalamocortical circuits as a potential mechanism. Our results open an avenue for the non-pharmacological treatment of {BECTS}.},

We found that spending at least 15 s in N1 during a resting period tripled the chance to discover the hidden rule (83\% versus 30\% when participants remained awake), and this effect vanished if subjects reached deeper sleep.

An assessment of what a participant is doing during a lapse may depict varying levels of "disengagement" during these events and provide more insight into the measurement of both a lapse and sleepiness. Design: Repeated measures Setting: Participants underwent extended 30-min {PVT} sessions twice, at 22:00 and 04:00, under: (i) typical non-distractive laboratory conditions, and (ii) an additional distractive condition. Participants: Twenty-four healthy young adults (mean age: 23.2 y ± 2 y; range 21-25 y [12 m; 12 f]) without any sleep or medical problems and without any prior indication of daytime sleepiness. Interventions: One night of sleep loss. Distraction comprised a {TV} located at 90° in the visual periphery showing a popular {TV} program. For the non-distraction condition, the {TV} was turned off. Measurements and Results: Video data (bird's-eye and frontal view) were used to classify each lapse (≥500 ms) as occurring with eyes open ({EO}), eyes closed ({EC}), or due to a head turn ({HT}). {EO} lapses were more prevalent, with all lapses ({EO}, {EC}, and {HT}) increasing with sleepiness. There was a significant effect of distraction for {HT} lapses which was exacerbated when sleepy. For lapse duration there was little effect of sleepiness for {EO} lapses but a significant effect for {EC} and {HT}. The 95\% confidence intervals for lapse duration and associated behavior showed those lapses greater than 2669 ms were 95\% likely to be {EC}, whereas those 500-549 ms were 95\% likely to be {EO}. Response times of 1217 ms had a 50:50 probability of being {EO}:{EC}. Conclusions: Discriminating the varying causes of lapses whether due to visual inattention (eyes open), microsleep (eyes closed), or distraction (head turn) may provide further insight into levels of disengagement from the {PVT} and further insight into developing sleepiness.},

	abstract = {Study Objectives: The low-frequency high-amplitude oscillations of slow-wave sleep ({SWS}) are considered to promote the consolidation of episodic memory. Previous research suggests that sleep slow waves can be entrained and enhanced by presenting short acoustic stimuli to the up-states of endogenous waves. Several studies have investigated the effects of these increases in slow-wave activity on overnight memory consolidation, with inconsistent results. The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the accumulated evidence connecting acoustic stimulation during sleep to episodic memory consolidation. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted in October 2020 using {PubMed}, Web of Science, and {PsycInfo}. The main study inclusion criteria were the application of acoustic slow wave enhancement in healthy participants and an assessment of pre-A nd post-sleep episodic memory performance. Effect sizes were pooled using a random-effects model. Results: A total of 10 primary studies with 11 experiments and 177 participants were included. Results showed a combined effect size (Hedges' g) of 0.25 (p = 0.07). Subgroup models based on young adults (n = 8), phase-locked stimulation approaches (n = 8), and their combination (n = 6) showed combined effect sizes of 0.31 (p = 0.051), 0.36 (p = 0.047), and 0.44 (p = 0.01), respectively. There was no indication of publication bias or bias in individual studies. Conclusions: Acoustic enhancement of {SWS} tends to increase the overnight consolidation of episodic memory but effects remain small and-with the exception of subgroup models-A t trend levels. Currently, the evidence is not sufficient to recommend the use of commercially available devices.},

In mouse motor cortex, sleep leads to an overall net decrease in spine-surface {GluA}1-containing {AMPA} receptors, both before and after learning. Molecular changes in single spines during post-learning sleep are correlated with changes in performance after sleep. The spines in which learning leads to the largest increase in {GluA}1 expression have a relative advantage after post-learning sleep compared to sleep deprivation, because sleep weakens all remaining spines.

	abstract = {Inconsistency in operationally defining sleep efficiency ({SE}) creates confusion with regard to the conceptualization and use of the construct by researchers and clinicians. The source of the inconsistency is the denominator of the widely published operational definition of {SE}: ratio of total sleep time ({TST}) to time in bed ({TIB}) (multiplied by 100 to yield a percentage). When taken literally, {TIB} includes non-sleep-related activity (e.g., reading, texting, conversing with a partner, watching television) both prior to initiating sleep and after the final awakening. However, the construct of {SE} refers to {TST} compared to the amount of time spent attempting to initially fall asleep and sleep discontinuity. Non-sleep related activities in bed do not reflect that construct. Also, time out of bed during nighttime awakenings, a manifestation of sleep discontinuity, should be included in the {SE} denominator. Using {TIB} as the denominator can also create a methodological problem when {SE} is an outcome measure in sleep intervention research. It is proposed that research and practice would benefit by clarifying and adopting a consistent operational definition that more accurately captures the construct of {SE}. An alternate denominator, duration of the sleep episode ({DSE}), is suggested, where {DSE} = sleep onset latency ({SOL}) + {TST} + time awake after initial sleep onset but before the final awakening ({WASO}) + time attempting to sleep after final awakening ({TASAFA}). The proposed formula for {SE} would be: {SE} = {TST} / {DSE} (× 100). {DSE} can be easily calculated using standard sleep diary entries along with one item from the Expanded Consensus Sleep Diary.

Recently, it was reported that {SWRs} were differentiated into multiple subtypes. However, whether cortical {UP} states can also be classified into subtypes is not known. Here, we analysed neural ensemble activity from the medial prefrontal cortex from rats trained to run a spatial sequence-memory task. Application of the hidden Markov model ({HMM}) with three states to epochs of {UP}–{DOWN} oscillations identified {DOWN} states and two subtypes of {UP} state ({UP}-1 and {UP}-2). The two {UP} subtypes were distinguished by differences in duration, with {UP}-1 having a longer duration than {UP}-2, as well as differences in the speed of population vector ({PV}) decorrelation, with {UP}-1 decorrelating more slowly than {UP}-2. Reactivation of recent memory sequences predominantly occurred in {UP}-2. Short-duration reactivating {UP} states were dominated by {UP}-2 whereas long-duration ones exhibit transitions from {UP}-1 to {UP}-2. Thus, recent memory reactivation, if it occurred within long-duration {UP} states, typically was preceded by a period of slow {PV} evolution not related to recent experience, and which we speculate may be related to previously encoded information. If that is the case, then the transition from {UP}-1 to {UP}-2 subtypes may help gradual integration of recent experience with pre-existing cortical memories by interleaving the two in the same {UP} state.

	abstract = {Background While neuroimaging has provided insights into the formation of episodic memories in relation to voluntary memory recall, less is known about neural mechanisms that cause memories to occur involuntarily, for example as intrusive memories of trauma. Here we investigated brain activity shortly after viewing distressing events as a function of whether memories for those events later intruded involuntarily. The post-encoding period is particularly important because it is a period when clinical interventions could be applied. Methods Thirty-two healthy volunteers underwent functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ({fMRI}) while viewing distressing film clips, interspersed with five minutes of awake (post-encoding) rest. Voluntary memories of the films were assessed using free recall and verbal and visual recognition tests after a week, while intrusive (involuntary) memories were recorded in a diary throughout that week. Results When analysing {fMRI} responses related to watching the films, we replicated findings that those “hotspots” (salient moments within the films) that would later become intrusive memories elicited higher activation in parts of the brain’s salience network. Surprisingly, while the post-encoding persistence of multi-voxel correlation structures associated with entire film clips predicted subsequent voluntary recall, there was no evidence that they predicted subsequent intrusions. Conclusions Results replicate findings regarding the formation of intrusive memories during encoding, and extend findings regarding the consolidation of information in post-encoding rest in relation to voluntary memory. While we provided a first step using a naturalistic paradigm, further research is needed to elucidate the role of post-encoding neural processes in the development of intrusive memories.},

	abstract = {There are two general strategies for solving a problem. Insight is the sudden realization of a novel idea or problem solution accompanied by an “aha” experience. Analysis occurs in a conscious, deliberate fashion without an “aha” experience. Previous research has shown that brain activity during a preparatory period immediately before a problem is presented can predict whether the subsequently presented problem will be solved by insight or by analysis. Those prior studies used a type of brief verbal problem called compound remote associates ({CRA}). To determine whether prestimulus activity predicts subsequent insight versus analytic solving for other types of problems, the present study used an anagram task. We examined high-density electroencephalograms ({EEGs}) immediately preceding the presentation of anagrams and found that during the 2-s prestimulus interval there was greater beta-band activity recorded over right central-parietal cortex prior to analytic solving compared with insightful solving. {EEG} source reconstruction showed that this activity originated in left mid-cingulate cortex ({MCC}) and the right postcentral gyrus. In contrast to prior work, we found no evidence of a significant interaction between insight-related prestimulus brain activity and positive mood, although positive mood was associated with greater activity in anterior cingulate cortex and with a larger number of insight solutions. The present {MCC} results suggest that participants’ anagram-solving strategies may be influenced by allostasis, that is, the estimation and marshalling of neurocognitive resources required to cope with an expected task. Specifically, when a participant adequately prepares for an upcoming problem, then {MCC} activity is high, enabling solution by resource-intensive analytic processing. Alternatively, when preparation is insufficient for analytic processing, then {MCC} activity is low and subsequent solving occurs by low-demand insight processing. The current findings and explanatory model differ from those of previous studies that used a {CRA} task, suggesting the possibility of complex interactions between task-type and procedure-type in determining the nature of prestimulus preparation. Future research examining such interactions may yield results that benefit educators who teach students problem-solving strategies.},

Anecdotal reports on scientific discovery suggest that pivotal insights can be gained through sleep. Sleep consolidates recent memories and, concomitantly, could allow insight by changing their representational structure. Here we show a facilitating role of sleep in a process of insight. Subjects performed a cognitive task requiring the learning of stimulus-response sequences, in which they improved gradually by increasing response speed across task blocks. However, they could also improve abruptly after gaining insight into a hidden abstract rule underlying all sequences. Initial training establishing a task representation was followed by 8 h of nocturnal sleep, nocturnal wakefulness, or daytime wakefulness. At subsequent retesting, more than twice as many subjects gained insight into the hidden rule after sleep as after wakefulness, regardless of time of day. Sleep did not enhance insight in the absence of initial training. A characteristic antecedent of sleep-related insight was revealed in a slowing of reaction times across sleep. We conclude that sleep, by restructuring new memory representations, facilitates extraction of explicit knowledge and insightful behaviour.},

However, these studies have not determined whether sleep is beneficial for problem solving or whether sleep merely mitigates against interference due to an interruption to solution attempts. Sleep-dependent improvements have been described in terms of spreading activation, which raises the prediction that an effect of sleep should be greater for problems requiring a broader solution search. We presented participants with a set of remote-associate tasks that varied in difficulty as a function of the strength of the stimuli-answer associations. After a period of sleep, wake, or no delay, participants reattempted previously unsolved problems. The sleep group solved a greater number of difficult problems than did the other groups, but no difference was found for easy problems.

In order to solve a problem successfully, the problem representation has to be restructured by combining elements of available knowledge in novel and creative ways. It has been suggested that sleep supports the reorganization of memory representations, ultimately aiding problem solving. In this study, we systematically tested the effect of sleep and time on problem solving, using classical insight tasks and magic tricks. Solving these tasks explicitly requires a restructuring of the problem representation and may be accompanied by a subjective feeling of insight. In two sessions, 77 participants had to solve classical insight problems and magic tricks. The two sessions either occurred consecutively or were spaced 3 h apart, with the time in between spent either sleeping or awake. We found that sleep affected neither general solution rates nor the number of solutions accompanied by sudden subjective insight. Our study thus adds to accumulating evidence that sleep does not provide an environment that facilitates the qualitative restructuring of memory representations and enables problem solving.},

However, how these new concepts are formed, especially through the processing of novelty and usefulness (which are usually regarded as the key properties of creativity), is not clear. Taking familiar and useful ({FU}) objects/designs as the starting point or fundamental baseline, we modified them into novel and useless ({NS}) objects/designs or novel and useful ({NU}) ones (i.e., truly creative ones) to investigate how the features of novelty and usefulness are processed (processing of novelty: {NU} minus {FU}; processing of usefulness: {NU} minus {NS}). Specifically, we predicted that the creative integration of novelty and usefulness entails not only the formation of new associations, which could be critically mediated by the hippocampus and adjacent medial temporal lobe ({MTL}) areas, but also the formation of new concepts or categories, which is supported by the middle temporal gyrus ({MTG}). We found that both the {MTL} and the {MTG} were involved in the processing of novelty and usefulness. The {MTG} showed distinctive patterns of information processing, reflected by strengthened functional connectivity with the hippocampus to construct new concepts and strengthened functional connectivity with the executive control system to break the boundaries of old concepts. Additionally, participants’ subjective evaluations of concept distance showed that the distance between the familiar concept ({FU}) and the successfully constructed concept ({NU}) was larger than that between the {FU} and the unsuccessfully constructed concept ({NS}), and this pattern was found to correspond to the patterns of their neural representations in the {MTG}. These findings demonstrate the critical mechanism by which new associations and concepts are formed during novelty and usefulness processing in creative design; this mechanism may be critically mediated by the hippocampus-{MTG} connection.},

The cognitive neuroscience literature in creativity and problem-solving is extensive, but it has largely focused on neural networks that are active when subjects are not focused on the outside world, i.e., not using their environment. In this paper, I attempt to combine the relevant literature on creativity and problem-solving with the scattered and nascent work in perceptually-driven learning from the environment. I present my synthesis as a potential new theory for real world problem-solving and map out its hypothesized neural basis.

Although such distortions are often retained or even enhanced over time, sleep's contribution to the development of false memories is unknown. Here, we report that a night of sleep increases both veridical and false recall in the Deese-Roediger-{McDermott} ({DRM}) paradigm, compared to an equivalent period of daytime wakefulness. But while veridical memory deteriorates across both wake and sleep, false memories are preferentially preserved by sleep, actually showing a non-significant improvement. The same selectivity of false over veridical memories was observed in a follow-up nap study. Unlike previous studies implicating deep, slow-wave sleep ({SWS}) in declarative memory consolidation, here veridical recall correlated with decreased {SWS}, a finding that was observed in both the overnight and nap studies. These findings lead to two counterintuitive conclusions - that under certain circumstances sleep can promote false memories over veridical ones, and {SWS} can be associated with impairment rather than facilitation of declarative memory consolidation. While these effects produce memories that are less accurate after sleep, these memories may, in the end, be more useful. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Moments of insight, a phenomenon of creative cognition in which an idea suddenly emerges into awareness as an “Aha!” are often reported to be affectively positive experiences. We tested the hypothesis that problem-solving by insight is accompanied by neural reward processing. We recorded high-density {EEGs} while participants solved a series of anagrams. For each solution, they reported whether the answer had occurred to them as a sudden insight or whether they had derived it deliberately and incrementally (i.e., “analytically’). Afterwards, they filled out a questionnaire that measures general dispositional reward sensitivity. We computed the time-frequency representations of the {EEGs} for trials with insight (I) solutions and trials with analytic (A) solutions and subtracted them to obtain an I-A time-frequency representation for each electrode. Statistical Parametric Mapping ({SPM}) analyses tested for significant I-A and reward-sensitivity effects. {SPM} revealed the time, frequency, and scalp locations of several I ​{\textgreater} ​A effects. No A ​{\textgreater} ​I effect was observed. The primary neural correlate of insight was a burst of (I ​{\textgreater} ​A) gamma-band oscillatory activity over prefrontal cortex approximately 500 ​ms before participants pressed a button to indicate that they had solved the problem. We correlated the I-A time-frequency representation with reward sensitivity to discover insight-related effects that were modulated by reward sensitivity. This revealed a separate anterior prefrontal burst of gamma-band activity, approximately 100 ​ms after the primary I-A insight effect, which we interpreted to be an insight-related reward signal. This interpretation was supported by source reconstruction showing that this signal was generated in part by orbitofrontal cortex, a region associated with reward learning and hedonically pleasurable experiences such as food, positive social experiences, addictive drugs, and orgasm. These findings support the notion that for many people insight is rewarding. Additionally, these results may explain why many people choose to engage in insight-generating recreational and vocational activities such as solving puzzles, reading murder mysteries, creating inventions, or doing research. This insight-related reward signal may be a manifestation of an evolutionarily adaptive mechanism for the reinforcement of exploration, problem solving, and creative cognition.},

The present study aimed at investigating the neural bases of the processes involved in overcoming fixation effects during creative idea generation. Using the {AU} task adapted for {EEG} recording, we examined whether participant's ability to provide original ideas was related to alpha power changes in both the frontal and temporo-parietal regions. Critically, for half of the presented objects, the classical use of the object was primed orally, and a picture of the classical use was presented visually to increase functional fixedness (Fixation Priming condition). For the other half, only the name of the object and a picture of the object was provided to the participants (control condition). As expected, priming the classical use of an object before the generation of creative alternative uses of the object impeded participants’ performances in terms of remoteness. In the control condition, while the frontal alpha synchronization was maintained across all successive time windows in participants with high remoteness scores, the frontal alpha synchronization decreased in participants with low remoteness scores. In the Fixation Priming condition, in which functional fixedness was maximal, both participants with high and low remoteness scores maintained frontal alpha synchronization throughout the period preceding their answer. Whereas participants with high remoteness scores maintained alpha synchronization in the temporo-parietal regions throughout the creative idea generation period, participants with low remoteness scores displayed alpha desynchronization in the same regions during this period. We speculate that individuals with high remoteness scores might generate more creative ideas than individuals with low remoteness scores because they rely more on internal semantic association and selection processes.},

In particular, stage-based models of the creative process are discussed and the evolution of these models is traced. Empirical research suggests that the basic 4-stage model of the creative process may need to be revised or replaced. Several key questions about the creative process are raised, such as how the creative process differs fromthe noncreative process and how process-related differences may lead to different levels of creative performance.

	abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy bynhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent {MM}- {GBSA} calculations. Using the best {RMSD} among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate ({RMSD} ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide {SP} settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta {FlexPepDock} method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

	abstract = {Memory is subject to dynamic changes, sometimes giving rise to the formation of false memories due to biased processes of consolidation or retrieval. Sleep is known to benefit memory consolidation through an active reorganization of representations whereas acute sleep deprivation impairs retrieval functions. Here, we investigated whether sleep after learning and sleep deprivation at retrieval enhance the generation of false memories in a free recall test. According to the Deese, Roediger, {McDermott} ({DRM}) false memory paradigm, subjects learned lists of semantically associated words (e.g., "night", "dark", "coal", etc.), lacking the strongest common associate or theme word (here: "black"). Free recall was tested after 9 h following a night of sleep, a night of wakefulness (sleep deprivation) or daytime wakefulness. Compared with memory performance after a retention period of daytime wakefulness, both post-learning nocturnal sleep as well as acute sleep deprivation at retrieval significantly enhanced false recall of theme words. However, these effects were only observed in subjects with low general memory performance. These data point to two different ways in which sleep affects false memory generation through semantic generalization: one acts during consolidation on the memory trace per se, presumably by active reorganization of the trace in the post-learning sleep period. The other is related to the recovery function of sleep and affects cognitive control processes of retrieval. Both effects are unmasked when the material is relatively weakly encoded.

Modern neuroscience and neuroimaging enable study of the processes during artistic performance. Creative people have less marked hemispheric dominance. It was found that the right hemisphere is specialized for metaphoric thinking, playfulness, solution finding and synthesizing, it is the center of visualization, imagination and conceptualization, but the left hemisphere is still needed for artistic work to achieve balance. A specific functional organization of brain areas was found during visual art activities. Marked hemispheric dominance and area specialization is also very prominent for music perception. Brain is capable of making new connections, activating new pathways and unmasking secondary roads, it is "plastic". Music is a strong stimulus for neuroplasticity. {fMRI} studies have shown reorganization of motor and auditory cortex in professional musicians. Other studies showed the changes in neurotransmitter and hormone serum levels in correlation to music. The most prominent connection between music and enhancement of performance or changing of neuropsychological activity was shown by studies involving Mozart's music from which the theory of "The Mozart Effect" was derived. Results of numerous studies showed that listening to music can improve cognition, motor skills and recovery after brain injury. In the field of visual art, brain lesion can lead to the visuospatial neglect, loss of details and significant impairment of artistic work while the lesions affecting the left hemisphere reveal new artistic dimensions, disinhibit the right hemisphere, work is more spontaneous and emotional with the gain of artistic quality. All kinds of arts (music, painting, dancing...) stimulate the brain. They should be part of treatment processes.

I also investigate whether non-monetary incentives can be just as effective as financial incentives in the insight problem task setting.  Results from a laboratory experiment shows that the effect of performance incentives (both financial incentives, e.g., piece-rate pay and non-financial incentives, e.g., recognition) are more positive when training is present than when it is absent.  In the absence of training, individuals receiving piece-rate pay solved fewer insight problems than those receiving fixed wage. There are no significant performance differences between those receiving fixed wage plus recognition and those receiving only fixed wage.  In the presence of training, performance of those receiving performance incentives (both piece-rate pay and fixed wage plus recognition) are marginally higher than those receiving fixed wage.  This study contributes to a better understanding of the conditions under which incentive schemes can have positive effects on employees’ ability to develop insight.  Since insight is often associated with innovation, my research can inform firms looking for ways to incorporate incentives into their innovation management practices.  Also, I find that non-monetary incentive schemes such as recognition can be an effective alternative to financial schemes, thus help to explain why firms often reward innovative employee behavior with symbolic prizes in public forums rather than with money.},

In a within-subjects design, 23 healthy adults underwent training and retest, with a retention period (approximately 8 hr) spent awake ({WK}, with training in the morning and retest in the afternoon) or asleep ({SL}, with training in the evening and retest in the morning). The main performance measure ({GLOB}) results from the total value of the letters used, the number of words, their length and the strategic use of bonus letters. An additional measure ({WORDS}, i.e., the proportion of words correctly detected over all detectable words) was also used, mainly reflecting procedural rather than strategic skills. In {WK}, although {GLOB} increased at retest, a significant improvement emerged only for {WORDS}, whereas in {SL} only {GLOB} was enhanced. In {WK}, the {GLOB} improvement appears to depend on the increase in the number of words detected ({GLOB} and {WORDS} improvement measures were positively associated), whereas in {SL} this association was not observed, indicating a shift to more complex but more rewarding strategies. Our data contribute to the understanding of everyday life learning processes by suggesting that sleep benefits memories of future relevance and promotes preferential consolidation of strategic skills when this is useful to achieve one's goal.},

It is thought that setting a problem aside before giving it another try aids problem-solving. The underlying mechanisms of such an incubation period could include unconscious processing that fosters spreading activation along associated networks and the restructuring of problem representations. Recently, it has been suggested that sleep may also support problem-solving by supporting the transformation and restructuring of memory elements. Since the effect of sleep on problem-solving has been mainly tested using the Remote Associates Test, we chose three different tasks - classical riddles, visual change detection, and anagrams - to examine various aspects of problem-solving and to pinpoint task-specific prerequisites for effects of sleep or incubation to emerge. Sixty-two participants were given two attempts to solve the problems. Both attempts either occurred consecutively or were spaced apart by a 3-hour incubation interval that was spent awake or asleep. We found that a period of incubation positively affected solutions rates in classical riddles, but not in visual change detection or anagram solving. Contrary to our hypothesis, spending the incubation period asleep, did not yield any additional benefit. Our study thus supports the notion that a period of letting a problem rest is beneficial for its solution and confines the role of sleep to memory transformations that do not directly impact on problem-solving ability.},

To determine the underlying cellular level mechanisms of this hippocampal deficit, we examined the impact of {SD} on several fundamental aspects of membrane excitability and synaptic physiology in hippocampal {CAI} pyramidal neurons and dentate gyrus granule cells. We found that neuronal excitability was severely reduced in {CA}1 neurons but not in granule cells and that the production of long-term potentiation of synaptic strength was inhibited in both areas. Using multiple {SD} methods we further attempted to differentiate the effects of sleep deprivation from those associated with the nonspecific stress induced by the sleep deprivation methods.

	abstract = {Sleep is universal, tightly regulated, and its loss impairs cognition. But why does the brain need todisconnect from the environment for hours every day? The synaptic homeostasis hypothesis ({SHY})proposes that sleep is the price the brain pays for plasticity. During a waking episode, learning statistical regularities about the current environment requires strengthening connections throughout thebrain. This increases cellular needs for energy and supplies, decreases signal-to-noise ratios, and saturates learning. During sleep, spontaneous activity renormalizes net synaptic strength and restores cellular homeostasis. Activity-dependent down-selection of synapses can also explain the benefits of sleep on memory acquisition, consolidation, and integration. This happens through the offline, comprehensive sampling of statistical regularities incorporated in neuronal circuits over a lifetime. This Perspective considers the rationale and evidence for {SHY} and points to open issues related to sleep and plasticity. What is the purpose of sleep?

This paper discusses a hypothesis about the significance of slow-wave activity and its homeostatic regulation.

	abstract = {The post-lunch dip in alertness and performance was widely experienced during the early afternoon. Taking a short nap was documented as a practical strategy for habitual nappers to counteract the decline of alertness and performance. Yet, it remains unknown whether bright light exposure in the early afternoon working hours could alleviate the performance deficits caused by a post-lunch nap loss for habitual nappers. Seventeen undergraduate students who had a long-term habit of taking a post-lunch nap were assigned to three interventions: (1) a short nap + normal indoor light (100 lx, 4,000 K at eye level); (2) no nap + normal indoor light, and (3) no nap + blue-enriched bright light (1,000 lx, 6,500 K at eye level), in which subjective alertness (Karolinska Sleepiness Scale, {KSS}), mood (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, {PANAS}), and task performance in sustained attention (psychomotor vigilance test, {PVT}), response inhibition (go/no-go task), and working memory (paced visual serial addition test, {PVSAT}) were measured. Results showed that a post-lunch nap deprivation significantly increased subjective sleepiness and negative mood and impaired performance in {PVT} and {PVSAT}, while exposure to bright blue-enriched white light vs. normal indoor light in the early afternoon significantly relieved such negative effects on mood, sleepiness, and performance in {PVSAT}; subjective positive mood and performance in {PVT} and go/no-go task remained unaffected with light intervention. These findings suggested that bright blue-enriched white light exposure could be a potential strategy for those who are suffering from drowsiness and low working memory following a habitual midday nap loss.},

	abstract = {Sleep deprivation severely compromises the ability of human beings to respond to stimuli in a timely fashion. These deficits have been attributed in large part to failures of vigilant attention, which many theorists believe forms the bedrock of the other more complex components of cognition. One of the leading paradigms used as an assay of vigilant attention is the psychomotor vigilance test ({PVT}), a high signal-load reaction-time test that is extremely sensitive to sleep deprivation. Over the last twenty years, four dominant findings have emerged from the use of this paradigm. First, sleep deprivation results in an overall slowing of responses. Second, sleep deprivation increases the propensity of individuals to lapse for lengthy periods ({\textgreater}500 ms), as well as make errors of commission. Third, sleep deprivation enhances the time-on-task effect within each test bout. Finally, {PVT} results during extended periods of wakefulness reveal the presence of interacting circadian and homeostatic sleep drives. A theme that links these findings is the interplay of "top-down" and "bottom-up" attention in producing the unstable and unpredictable patterns of behavior that are the hallmark of the sleep-deprived state. © 2008 New York Academy of Sciences.},

Design: Subjects took the {PVT} twice while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging: once 12 hours after waking from a normal night of sleep and once after 36 hours of total sleep deprivation ({TSD}). Session order was counterbalanced. Setting: {UCSD} J. Christian Gillin Laboratory for Sleep and Chronobiology (the sleep core of the General Clinical Research Center) and {UCSD} Magnetic Resonance Institute. Patients or Participants: Twenty right-handed healthy adults (8 women; age = 27.4 ± 6.7 years; education = 15.6 ± 1.5 years.) Measurements and Results: After a normal night of sleep, optimal performance was related to greater cerebral responses within a cortical sustained attention network and the cortical and subcortical motor systems. Slow reaction times, particularly after {TSD}, were associated with greater activity in the "default mode network" consisting of frontal and posterior midline regions. Conclusions: Optimal performance on the {PVT} appears to rely on activation both within the sustained attention system and within the motor system. Poor performance following {TSD} may result from a disengagement from the task and related inattention, and brain regions responsible for this localize within midline structures shown to be involved in the brain's "default mode." Finally, particularly poor performance after {TSD} may elicit a subsequent attentional recovery that manifests as greater activation within the same regions normally responsible for fast reaction times.},

	abstract = {Study Objectives: The Psychomotor Vigilance Test ({PVT}) is reported to be free of practice effects that can otherwise confound the effects of sleep loss and circadian misalignment on performance. This differentiates the {PVT} from more complex cognitive tests. To the best of our knowledge, no study has systematically investigated practice effects on the {PVT} across multiple outcome domains, depending on administration interval, and in ecologically more valid settings. Methods: We administered a validated 3-minute {PVT} ({PVT}-B) 16 times in 45 participants (23 male, mean ± {SD} age 32.6 ± 7.3 years, range 25–54 years) with administration intervals of ?10 days, ?5 days, or 4 times per day. We investigated linear and logarithmic trends across repeated administrations in 10 {PVT}-B outcome variables. Results: The fastest 10\% of response times ({RT}; plin = .0002), minimum {RT} (plog = .0010), and the slowest 10\% of reciprocal {RT} (plog = .0124) increased while false starts (plog = 0.0050) decreased with repeated administration, collectively decreasing {RT} variability (plog = .0010) across administrations. However, the observed absolute changes were small (e.g., ?0.03 false starts per administration, linear fit) and are probably irrelevant in practice. Test administration interval did not modify the effects of repeated administration on {PVT}-B performance (all p {\textgreater} .13 for interaction). Importantly, mean and median {RT}, response speed, and lapses, which are among the most frequently used {PVT} outcomes, did not change systematically with repeated administration. Conclusions: {PVT}-B showed stable performance across repeated administrations. Combined with its high sensitivity, this corroborates the status of the {PVT} as the de facto gold standard measure of the neurobehavioral effects of sleep loss and circadian misalignment.},

	abstract = {Study Objectives: The psychomotor vigilance test ({PVT}) is among the most widely used measures of behavioral alertness, but there is large variation among published studies in {PVT} performance outcomes and test durations. To promote standardization of the {PVT} and increase its sensitivity and specificity to sleep loss, we determined {PVT} metrics and task durations that optimally discriminated sleep deprived subjects from alert subjects. Design: Repeated-measures experiments involving 10-min {PVT} assessments every 2 h across both acute total sleep deprivation ({TSD}) and 5 days of chronic partial sleep deprivation ({PSD}).Setting: Controlled laboratory environment. Participants: 74 healthy subjects (34 female), aged 22-45 years. Interventions: {TSD} experiment involving 33 h awake (N = 31 subjects) and a {PSD} experiment involving 5 nights of 4 h time in bed (N = 43 subjects). Measurements and Results: In a paired t-test paradigm and for both {TSD} and {PSD}, effect sizes of 10 different {PVT} performance outcomes were calculated. Effect sizes were high for both {TSD} (1.59-1.94) and {PSD} (0.88-1.21) for {PVT} metrics related to lapses and to measures of psychomotor speed, i.e., mean 1/{RT} (response time) and mean slowest 10\% 1/{RT}. In contrast, {PVT} mean and median {RT} outcomes scored low to moderate effect sizes influenced by extreme values. Analyses facilitating only portions of the full 10-min {PVT} indicated that for some outcomes, high effect sizes could be achieved with {PVT} durations considerably shorter than 10 min, although metrics involving lapses seemed to profit from longer test durations in {TSD}. Conclusions: Due to their superior conceptual and statistical properties and high sensitivity to sleep deprivation, metrics involving response speed and lapses should be considered primary outcomes for the 10-min {PVT}. In contrast, {PVT} mean and median metrics, which are among the most widely used outcomes, should be avoided as primary measures of alertness. Our analyses also suggest that some shorter-duration {PVT} versions may be sensitive to sleep loss, depending on the outcome variable selected, although this will need to be confirmed in comparative analyses of separate duration versions of the {PVT}. Using both sensitive {PVT} metrics and optimal test durations maximizes the sensitivity of the {PVT} to sleep loss and therefore potentially decreases the sample size needed to detect the same neurobehavioral deficit. We propose criteria to better standardize the 10-min {PVT} and facilitate between-study comparisons and meta-analyses. © Copyright 2011 Associated Professional Sleep Societies, {LLC}.},

The aim of this study was to assess the signal acquisition and the performance of the automatic sleep staging algorithms of a reduced-montage dry-electroencephalographic ({EEG}) device (Dreem headband, {DH}) compared to the gold-standard polysomnography ({PSG}) scored by five sleep experts. Methods: A total of 25 subjects who completed an overnight sleep study at a sleep center while wearing both a {PSG} and the {DH} simultaneously have been included in the analysis. We assessed (1) similarity of measured {EEG} brain waves between the {DH} and the {PSG}; (2) the heart rate, breathing frequency, and respiration rate variability ({RRV}) agreement between the {DH} and the {PSG}; and (3) the performance of the {DH}'s automatic sleep staging according to American Academy of Sleep Medicine guidelines versus {PSG} sleep experts manual scoring. Results: The mean percentage error between the {EEG} signals acquired by the {DH} and those from the {PSG} for the monitoring of α was 15 ± 3.5\%, 16 ± 4.3\% for β, 16 ± 6.1\% for λ, and 10 ± 1.4\% for θ frequencies during sleep. The mean absolute error for heart rate, breathing frequency, and {RRV} was 1.2 ± 0.5 bpm, 0.3 ± 0.2 cpm, and 3.2 ± 0.6\%, respectively. Automatic sleep staging reached an overall accuracy of 83.5 ± 6.4\% (F1 score: 83.8 ± 6.3) for the {DH} to be compared with an average of 86.4 ± 8.0\% (F1 score: 86.3 ± 7.4) for the 5 sleep experts. Conclusions: These results demonstrate the capacity of the {DH} to both monitor sleep-related physiological signals and process them accurately into sleep stages.

	abstract = {Conduction time is typically ignored in computational models of neural network function. Here we consider the effects of conduction delays on the synchrony of neuronal activity and neural oscillators, and evaluate the consequences of allowing conduction velocity ({CV}) to be regulated adaptively. We propose that {CV} variation, mediated by myelin, could provide an important mechanism of activity-dependent nervous system plasticity. Even small changes in {CV}, resulting from small changes in myelin thickness or nodal structure, could have profound effects on neuronal network function in terms of spike-time arrival, oscillation frequency, oscillator coupling, and propagation of brain waves. For example, a conduction delay of 5 ms could change interactions of two coupled oscillators at the upper end of the gamma frequency range (∼100 Hz) from constructive to destructive interference; delays smaller than 1 ms could change the phase by 30°, significantly affecting signal amplitude. Myelin plasticity, as another form of activity- dependent plasticity, is relevant not only to nervous system development but also to complex information processing tasks that involve coupling and synchrony among different brain rhythms. We use coupled oscillator models with time delays to explore the importance of adaptive time delays and adaptive synaptic strengths. The impairment of activity-dependent myelination and the loss of adaptive time delays may contribute to disorders where hyper- and hypo-synchrony of neuronal firing leads to dysfunction (e.g., dyslexia, schizophrenia, epilepsy)},

	abstract = {Sleep is regulated by a homeostatic and a circadian process. Together these two processes determine most aspects of sleep and related variables like sleepiness and alertness. The two processes are known to be able to work independently, but also to both influence sleep and sleep related variables in an additive or more complex manner. The question remains whether the two processes are directly influencing each other. The present review summarizes evidence from behavioural and electroencephalographic determined sleep, electrophysiology, gene knock out mouse models, and mathematical modelling to explore whether sleep homeostasis can influence circadian clock functioning and vice versa. There is a multitude of data available showing parallel action or influence of sleep homeostatic mechanisms and the circadian clock on several objective and subjective variables related to sleep and alertness. However, the evidence of a direct influence of the circadian clock on sleep homeostatic mechanisms is sparse and more research is needed, particularly applying longer sleep deprivations that include a second night. The strongest evidence of an influence of sleep homeostatic mechanisms on clock functioning comes from sleep deprivation experiments, demonstrating an attenuation of phase shifts of the circadian rhythm to light pulses when sleep homeostatic pressure is increased. The data suggest that the circadian clock is less susceptible to light when sleep pressure is high. The available data indicate that a strong central clock will induce periods of deep sleep, which in turn will strengthen clock function. Both are therefore important for health and wellbeing. Weakening of one will also hamper functioning of the other. Shift work and jet lag are situations where one tries to adapt to zeitgebers in a condition where sleep is compromised. Adaptation to zeitgebers may be improved by introducing nap schedules to reduce sleep pressure, and through that increasing clock susceptibility to light.},

	abstract = {Two processes play a dominant role in sleep regulation: a sleep-dependent process (Process S) and a sleep-independent circadian process (Process C). The time course of Process S was derived from the spectral analysis of slow wave activity in the human {EEG}. Its level shows an exponential decline during sleep and an increase during waking. The level of Process S at sleep onset is therefore a function of prior waking time. Process C is reflected by the rhythmic variation of sleep propensity during prolonged sleep deprivation, and is assumed to be controlled by a circadian oscillator. In the model, sleep propensity and the duration of sleep are determined by the combined action of the two processes. The model is able to simulate the variations of sleep duration as a function of sleep onset time. Since the amount of {REM} sleep is little influenced by prior sleep or waking and shows a marked circadian rhythmicity, it is assumed to reflect largely the level of Process C. The cyclic alternation of {nonREM} and {REM} sleep is assumed to result from a reciprocal interaction between the two sleep states. In contrast to previous models, only a single circadian oscillator is required to account for the sleep-wake cycle and the sleep organization under entrained and non-entrained schedules. The model also encompasses sleep regulation in animals and may provide indications as to the phylogenetic origin of sleep.},

	abstract = {In the last three decades the two-process model of sleep regulation has served as a major conceptual framework in sleep research. It has been applied widely in studies on fatigue and performance and to dissect individual differences in sleep regulation. The model posits that a homeostatic process (Process S) interacts with a process controlled by the circadian pacemaker (Process C), with time-courses derived from physiological and behavioural variables. The model simulates successfully the timing and intensity of sleep in diverse experimental protocols. Electrophysiological recordings from the suprachiasmatic nuclei ({SCN}) suggest that S and C interact continuously. Oscillators outside the {SCN} that are linked to energy metabolism are evident in {SCN}-lesioned arrhythmic animals subjected to restricted feeding or methamphetamine administration, as well as in human subjects during internal desynchronization. In intact animals these peripheral oscillators may dissociate from the central pacemaker rhythm. A sleep/fast and wake/feed phase segregate antagonistic anabolic and catabolic metabolic processes in peripheral tissues. A deficiency of Process S was proposed to account for both depressive sleep disturbances and the antidepressant effect of sleep deprivation. The model supported the development of novel non-pharmacological treatment paradigms in psychiatry, based on manipulating circadian phase, sleep and light exposure. In conclusion, the model remains conceptually useful for promoting the integration of sleep and circadian rhythm research. Sleep appears to have not only a short-term, use-dependent function; it also serves to enforce rest and fasting, thereby supporting the optimization of metabolic processes at the appropriate phase of the 24-h cycle.},

Several interventions potentially improving the sleep disturbance in {ICU} (sleep-promotion strategies) have been assumed and tested for clinical practice. We present a review of recent literature focused on chosen types of non-pharmacological interventions (earplugs and eye mask) analysing their effect on sleep quality/quantity.

Most of the reviewed studies showed a significant improvement of subjective sleep quality when using described non-pharmacological interventions (objective parameters were not significantly validated). Measuring the sleep quality is a major concern limiting the objective comparison of the studies’ results since non-standardised (and mainly individual) tools for sleep quality assessment were used. Despite the heterogeneity of analysed studies and some common methodological issues (sample size, design, outcome parameters choice and comparison) earplugs and eye mask showed potential positive effects on sleep quality and the incidence of delirium in {ICU} patients.},

The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of earplugs and eye mask on sleep architecture in {ICU} patients. Methods: A single-center randomized controlled trial of 64 {ICU} patients was conducted from July 2012 to December 2013. Patients were randomly assigned to sleep with or without earplugs and an eye mask from inclusion until {ICU} discharge. Polysomnography was performed on the first day and night following inclusion. The primary outcome was the proportion of stage N3 sleep over total sleep time. Secondary outcomes were other descriptors of sleep and major outcome variables. Results: In the intervention group, nine (30\%) patients did not wear earplugs all night long. The proportion of N3 sleep was 21 [7-28]\% in the intervention group and 11 [3-23]\% in the control group (p=0.09). The duration of N3 sleep was higher among the patients in the intervention group who wore earplugs all night long than in the control group (74 [32-106] vs. 31 [7-76] minutes, p=0.039). The number of prolonged awakenings was smaller in the intervention group (21 [19-26] vs. 31 [21-47] in the control group, p=0.02). No significant difference was observed between the two groups in terms of clinical outcome variables. Conclusions: Earplugs and eye mask reduce long awakenings and increase N3 duration when they are well tolerated. Trial registration: {ClinicalTrials}.gov, {NCT}02292134. Registered on 21 Nov 2013.},

	abstract = {Light is the primary synchronizer of the human biological clock. In more than half of those blind individuals who completely lack light perception, the absence of photic input to the hypothalamic circadian pacemaker results in rhythms that free-run (blind free-runners [{BFRs}]) with a period typically greater than 24 h. The remainder are entrained, although sometimes at an abnormal phase angle. It is presumed that weak as-yet-to-be-identified time cues provide the necessary resetting stimulus in these entrained individuals. These weak Zeitgebers might be expected to modulate the observed circadian period in blind people who are not actually entrained by them. The authors report here the results from 5 {BFRs} (average linear regression period ±{SD} of 24.31 ± 0.06 h) who had high-resolution (many and frequent) phase assessments. All 5 subjects demonstrated a similar and reproducible pattern of changes in observed period (period response curves) indicative of relative coordination. The precise shape of the period response curve to weak Zeitgebers has implications for the entrainment of {BFRs} using exogenous melatonin administration or other nonphotic stimuli. Sighted individuals may also be affected by such weak zeitgebers, which may be obscured by the stronger light/dark cycle. © 2005 Sage Publications.},

	abstract = {Conduction time is typically ignored in computational models of neural network function. Here we consider the effects of conduction delays on the synchrony of neuronal activity and neural oscillators, and evaluate the consequences of allowing conduction velocity ({CV}) to be regulated adaptively. We propose that {CV} variation, mediated by myelin, could provide an important mechanism of activity-dependent nervous system plasticity. Even small changes in {CV}, resulting from small changes in myelin thickness or nodal structure, could have profound effects on neuronal network function in terms of spike-time arrival, oscillation frequency, oscillator coupling, and propagation of brain waves. For example, a conduction delay of 5 ms could change interactions of two coupled oscillators at the upper end of the gamma frequency range (∼100 Hz) from constructive to destructive interference; delays smaller than 1 ms could change the phase by 30°, significantly affecting signal amplitude. Myelin plasticity, as another form of activity- dependent plasticity, is relevant not only to nervous system development but also to complex information processing tasks that involve coupling and synchrony among different brain rhythms. We use coupled oscillator models with time delays to explore the importance of adaptive time delays and adaptive synaptic strengths. The impairment of activity-dependent myelination and the loss of adaptive time delays may contribute to disorders where hyper- and hypo-synchrony of neuronal firing leads to dysfunction (e.g., dyslexia, schizophrenia, epilepsy)},

	abstract = {Humans live in a 24-hour environment, in which light and darkness follow a diurnal pattern. Our circadian pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nuclei ({SCN}) in the hypothalamus, is entrained to the 24-hour solar day via a pathway from the retina and synchronises our internal biological rhythms. Rhythmic variations in ambient illumination impact behaviours such as rest during sleep and activity during wakefulness as well as their underlying biological processes. Rather recently, the availability of artificial light has substantially changed the light environment, especially during evening and night hours. This may increase the risk of developing circadian rhythm sleep–wake disorders ({CRSWD}), which are often caused by a misalignment of endogenous circadian rhythms and external light–dark cycles. While the exact relationship between the availability of artificial light and {CRSWD} remains to be established, nocturnal light has been shown to alter circadian rhythms and sleep in humans. On the other hand, light can also be used as an effective and noninvasive therapeutic option with little to no side effects, to improve sleep, mood and general well-being. This article reviews our current state of knowledge regarding the effects of light on circadian rhythms, sleep, and mood.},

Bright light treatment and exogenous melatonin administration are considered to be the treatments of choice for these circadian rhythm sleep disorders. Circadian phase needs to be estimated in order to time the treatments appropriately. Inappropriately timed bright light and melatonin will likely worsen the condition. Measurements of core body temperature or endogenous melatonin rhythms will objectively assess circadian phase; however, such measurements are seldom or never used in a busy clinical practice. This review will focus on how to estimate circadian phase based on a careful patient history. Based on such estimations of circadian phase, we will recommend appropriate timing of bright light and/or melatonin in the different circadian rhythm sleep disorders.

	abstract = {Study objectives: To determine the effect of light exposure on subsequent sleep characteristics under ambulatory field conditions. Methods: Twenty healthy participants were fitted with ambulatory polysomnography ({PSG}) and wrist-actigraphs to assess light exposure, rest–activity, sleep quality, timing, and architecture. Laboratory salivary dim-light melatonin onset was analyzed to determine endogenous circadian phase. Results: Later circadian clock phase was associated with lower intensity (R2 = 0.34, ?2(1) = 7.19, p {\textless} .01), later light exposure (quadratic, controlling for daylength, R2 = 0.47, ?2(3) = 32.38, p {\textless} .0001), and to later sleep timing (R2 = 0.71, ?2(1) = 20.39, p {\textless} .0001). Those with later first exposure to more than 10 lux of light had more awakenings during subsequent sleep (controlled for daylength, R2 = 0.36, ?2(2) = 8.66, p {\textless} .05). Those with later light exposure subsequently had a shorter latency to first rapid eye movement ({REM}) sleep episode (R2 = 0.21, ?2(1) = 5.77, p {\textless} .05). Those with less light exposure subsequently had a higher percentage of {REM} sleep (R2 = 0.43, ?2(2) = 13.90, p {\textless} .001) in a clock phase modulated manner. Slow-wave sleep accumulation was observed to be larger after preceding exposure to high maximal intensity and early first light exposure (p {\textless} .05). Conclusions: The quality and architecture of sleep is associated with preceding light exposure. We propose that light exposure timing and intensity do not only modulate circadian-driven aspects of sleep but also homeostatic sleep pressure. These novel ambulatory {PSG} findings are the first to highlight the direct relationship between light and subsequent sleep, combining knowledge of homeostatic and circadian regulation of sleep by light. Upon confirmation by interventional studies, this hypothesis could change current understanding of sleep regulation and its relationship to prior light exposure.

It is based on a sleep-regulating variable (S) - possibly, but not necessarily, associated with a neurochemical substance - which increases during wakefulness and decreases during sleep. Sleep onset is triggered when S approaches an upper threshold (H); awakening occurs when S reaches a lower threshold (L). The thresholds show a circadian rhythm controlled by a single circadian pacemaker. Time constants of the S process were derived from rates of change of electroencephalographic ({EEG}) power density during regular sleep and during recovery from sleep deprivation. The waveform of the circadian threshold fluctuations was derived from spontaneous wake-up times after partial sleep deprivation. The model allows computer simulations of the main phenomena of human sleep timing, such as 1) internal desynchronization in the absence of time cues, 2) sleep fragmentation during continuous bed rest, and 3) circadian phase dependence of sleep duration during isolation from time cues, recovery from sleep deprivation, and shift work. The model shows that the experimental data are consistent with the concept of a single circadian pacemaker in humans. It has implications for the understanding of sleep as a restorative process and its timing with respect to day and night.},

	abstract = {What accounts for feeling deeply asleep? Standard sleep recordings only incompletely reflect subjective aspects of sleep and some individuals with so-called sleep misperception frequently feel awake although sleep recordings indicate clear-cut sleep. To identify the determinants of sleep perception, we performed 787 awakenings in 20 good sleepers and 10 individuals with sleep misperception and interviewed them about their subjective sleep depth while they underwent high-density {EEG} sleep recordings. Surprisingly, in good sleepers, sleep was subjectively lightest in the first 2 h of non-rapid eye movement ({NREM}) sleep, generally considered the deepest sleep, and deepest in rapid eye movement ({REM}) sleep. Compared to good sleepers, sleep misperceptors feltmore frequently awake during sleep and reported lighter {REM} sleep. At the {EEG} level, spatially widespread high-frequency power was inversely related to subjective sleep depth in {NREM} sleep in both groups and in {REM} sleep in misperceptors. Subjective sleep depth positively correlated with dream-like qualities of reports of mental activity. These findings challenge the widely held notion that slow wave sleep best accounts for feeling deeply asleep. Instead, they indicate that subjective sleep depth is inversely related to a neurophysiological process that predominates in early {NREM} sleep, becomes quiescent in {REM} sleep, and is reflected in high-frequency {EEG} activity. In sleep misperceptors, this process is more frequently active, more spatially widespread, and abnormally persists into {REM} sleep. These findings help identify the neuromodulatory systems involved in subjective sleep depth and are relevant for studies aiming to improve subjective sleep quality.},

We here report how a selective disruption of deep sleep only, that is, selective slow-wave activity ({SWA}) reduction, affects the performance of healthy well-sleeping subjects on several tasks: a " simple" and a " complex" vigilance task, a declarative learning task, and an implicit learning task despite unchanged duration of sleep.We used automated electroencephalogram ({EEG}) dependent acoustic feedback aimed at selective interference with-and reduction of-{SWA}. In a within-subject repeated measures crossover design, performance on the tasks was assessed in 13 elderly adults without sleep complaints after either {SWA}-reduction or after normal sleep.The number of vigilance lapses increased as a result of {SWA} reduction, irrespective of the type of vigilance task. Recognition on the declarative memory task was also affected by {SWA} reduction, associated with a decreased activation of the right hippocampus on encoding (measured with {fMRI}) suggesting a weaker memory trace. {SWA} reduction, however, did not affect reaction time on either of the vigilance tasks or implicit memory task performance.These findings suggest a specific role of slow oscillations in the subsequent daytime ability to maintain sustained attention and to encode novel declarative information but not to maintain response speed or to build implicit memories. Of particular interest is that selective {SWA} reduction can mimic some of the effects of total sleep deprivation, while not affecting sleep duration. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Whether sleep before learning is equally essential for the initial formation of new memories, however, remains an open question. We report that a single night of sleep deprivation produces a significant deficit in hippocampal activity during episodic memory encoding, resulting in worse subsequent retention. Furthermore, these hippocampal impairments instantiate a different pattern of functional connectivity in basic alertness networks of the brainstem and thalamus. We also find that unique prefrontal regions predict the success of encoding for sleep-deprived individuals relative to those who have slept normally. These results demonstrate that an absence of prior sleep substantially compromises the neural and behavioral capacity for committing new experiences to memory. It therefore appears that sleep before learning is critical in preparing the human brain for next-day memory formation - a worrying finding considering society's increasing erosion of sleep time. © 2007 Nature Publishing Group.},

	abstract = {Reduced sleep duration and quality appear to be endemic in modern society. Curtailment of the bedtime period to minimum tolerability is thought to be efficient and harmless by many. It has been known for several decades that sleep is a major modulator of hormonal release, glucose regulation and cardiovascular function. In particular, slow wave sleep ({SWS}), thought to be the most restorative sleep stage, is associated with decreased heart rate, blood pressure, sympathetic nervous activity and cerebral glucose utilization, compared with wakefulness. During {SWS}, the anabolic growth hormone is released while the stress hormone cortisol is inhibited. In recent years, laboratory and epidemiologic evidence have converged to indicate that sleep loss may be a novel risk factor for obesity and type 2 diabetes. The increased risk of obesity is possibly linked to the effect of sleep loss on hormones that play a major role in the central control of appetite and energy expenditure, such as leptin and ghrelin. Reduced leptin and increased ghrelin levels correlate with increases in subjective hunger when individuals are sleep restricted rather than well rested. Given the evidence, sleep curtailment appears to be an important, yet modifiable, risk factor for the metabolic syndrome, diabetes and obesity. The marked decrease in average sleep duration in the last 50 years coinciding with the increased prevalence of obesity, together with the observed adverse effects of recurrent partial sleep deprivation on metabolism and hormonal processes, may have important implications for public health. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Sleep deprivation is commonplace in modern society, but its far-reaching effects on cognitive performance are only beginning to be understood from a scientific perspective. While there is broad consensus that insufficient sleep leads to a general slowing of response speed and increased variability in performance, particularly for simple measures of alertness, attention and vigilance, there is much less agreement about the effects of sleep deprivation on many higher level cognitive capacities, including perception, memory and executive functions. Central to this debate has been the question of whether sleep deprivation affects nearly all cognitive capacities in a global manner through degraded alertness and attention, or whether sleep loss specifically impairs some aspects of cognition more than others. Neuroimaging evidence has implicated the prefrontal cortex as a brain region that may be particularly susceptible to the effects of sleep loss, but perplexingly, executive function tasks that putatively measure prefrontal functioning have yielded inconsistent findings within the context of sleep deprivation. Whereas many convergent and rule-based reasoning, decision making and planning tasks are relatively unaffected by sleep loss, more creative, divergent and innovative aspects of cognition do appear to be degraded by lack of sleep. Emerging evidence suggests that some aspects of higher level cognitive capacities remain degraded by sleep deprivation despite restoration of alertness and vigilance with stimulant countermeasures, suggesting that sleep loss may affect specific cognitive systems above and beyond the effects produced by global cognitive declines or impaired attentional processes. Finally, the role of emotion as a critical facet of cognition has received increasing attention in recent years and mounting evidence suggests that sleep deprivation may particularly affect cognitive systems that rely on emotional data. Thus, the extent to which sleep deprivation affects a particular cognitive process may depend on several factors, including the magnitude of global decline in general alertness and attention, the degree to which the specific cognitive function depends on emotion-processing networks, and the extent to which that cognitive process can draw upon associated cortical regions for compensatory support. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Most studies have been naturalistic correlative investigations, where sleep schedules were correlated with school and academic achievement. Nonetheless, some authors were able to actively manipulate sleep in order to observe neurocognitive and behavioral consequences, such as learning, memory capacity and school performance. The findings strongly suggest that: (a) students of different education levels (from school to university) are chronically sleep deprived or suffer from poor sleep quality and consequent daytime sleepiness; (b) sleep quality and quantity are closely related to student learning capacity and academic performance; (c) sleep loss is frequently associated with poor declarative and procedural learning in students; (d) studies in which sleep was actively restricted or optimized showed, respectively, a worsening and an improvement in neurocognitive and academic performance. These results may been related to the specific involvement of the prefrontal cortex ({PFC}) in vulnerability to sleep loss.

	abstract = {Sleep is important for normative cognitive functioning. A single night of total sleep deprivation can reduce the capacity to encode new memories. However, it is unclear how sleep restriction during several consecutive nights affects memory encoding. To explore this, we employed a parallel-group design with 59 adolescents randomized into sleep-restricted ({SR}) and control groups. Both groups were afforded 9 h time in bed ({TIB}) for 2 baseline nights, followed by 5 consecutive nights of 5 h {TIB} for the {SR} group (n = 29) and 9 h {TIB} for the control group (n = 30). Participants then performed a picture-encoding task. Encoding ability was measured with a recognition test after 3 nights of 9 h {TIB} recovery sleep for both groups, allowing the assessment of encoding ability without the confounding effects of fatigue at retrieval. Memory was significantly worse in the sleep-restricted group (P = 0.001), and this impairment was not correlated with decline in vigilance. We conclude that memory-encoding deteriorates after several nights of partial sleep restriction, and this typical pattern of sleep negatively affects adolescents’ ability to learn declarative information.},

	abstract = {As well as consolidating memory, sleep has been proposed to serve a second important function for memory, i.e. to free capacities for the learning of new information during succeeding wakefulness. The slow wave activity ({SWA}) that is a hallmark of slow wave sleep could be involved in both functions. Here, we aimed to demonstrate a causative role for {SWA} in enhancing the capacity for encoding of information during subsequent wakefulness, using transcranial slow oscillation stimulation ({tSOS}) oscillating at 0.75 Hz to induce {SWA} in healthy humans during an afternoon nap. Encoding following the nap was tested for hippocampus-dependent declarative materials (pictures, word pairs, and word lists) and procedural skills (finger sequence tapping). As compared with a sham stimulation control condition, {tSOS} during the nap enhanced {SWA} and significantly improved subsequent encoding on all three declarative tasks (picture recognition, cued recall of word pairs, and free recall of word lists), whereas procedural finger sequence tapping skill was not affected. Our results indicate that sleep {SWA} enhances the capacity for encoding of declarative materials, possibly by down-scaling hippocampal synaptic networks that were potentiated towards saturation during the preceding period of wakefulness. © 2013 Federation of European Neuroscience Societies and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Consolidation during sleep promotes both quantitative and qualitative changes of memory representations. Through specific patterns of neuromodulatory activity and electric field potential oscillations, slow-wave sleep ({SWS}) and rapid eye movement ({REM}) sleep support system consolidation and synaptic consolidation, respectively. During {SWS}, slow oscillations, spindles and ripples at minimum cholinergic activity coordinate the re-activation and redistribution of hippocampus-dependent memories to neocortical sites, whereas during {REM} sleep, local increases in plasticity-related immediate-early gene activity at high cholinergic and theta activity might favour the subsequent synaptic consolidation of memories in the cortex. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

	abstract = {Sleep deprivation is commonplace in modern society, but its far-reaching effects on cognitive performance are only beginning to be understood from a scientific perspective. While there is broad consensus that insufficient sleep leads to a general slowing of response speed and increased variability in performance, particularly for simple measures of alertness, attention and vigilance, there is much less agreement about the effects of sleep deprivation on many higher level cognitive capacities, including perception, memory and executive functions. Central to this debate has been the question of whether sleep deprivation affects nearly all cognitive capacities in a global manner through degraded alertness and attention, or whether sleep loss specifically impairs some aspects of cognition more than others. Neuroimaging evidence has implicated the prefrontal cortex as a brain region that may be particularly susceptible to the effects of sleep loss, but perplexingly, executive function tasks that putatively measure prefrontal functioning have yielded inconsistent findings within the context of sleep deprivation. Whereas many convergent and rule-based reasoning, decision making and planning tasks are relatively unaffected by sleep loss, more creative, divergent and innovative aspects of cognition do appear to be degraded by lack of sleep. Emerging evidence suggests that some aspects of higher level cognitive capacities remain degraded by sleep deprivation despite restoration of alertness and vigilance with stimulant countermeasures, suggesting that sleep loss may affect specific cognitive systems above and beyond the effects produced by global cognitive declines or impaired attentional processes. Finally, the role of emotion as a critical facet of cognition has received increasing attention in recent years and mounting evidence suggests that sleep deprivation may particularly affect cognitive systems that rely on emotional data. Thus, the extent to which sleep deprivation affects a particular cognitive process may depend on several factors, including the magnitude of global decline in general alertness and attention, the degree to which the specific cognitive function depends on emotion-processing networks, and the extent to which that cognitive process can draw upon associated cortical regions for compensatory support. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Many immune parameters show systematic fluctuations over the 24-h day in human blood. Circulating naive T-cells and production of proinflammatory cytokines, like interleukin-12 ({IL}-12), peak during nighttime, whereas cytotoxic effector leukocytes and production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine {IL}-10 peak during daytime. These temporal changes originate from a combined influence of the circadian system and sleep. Both brain functions act synergistically and share neuroendocrine effector mechanisms to convey control over immune functions. Sympathetic tone and cortisol levels show a circadian nadir during nighttime and are further suppressed by sleep, whereas growth hormone and prolactin show a circadian peak during nighttime and are further enhanced by sleep. Thus, the circadian system and sleep jointly evoke a unique endocrine constellation that is extremely effective in inducing changes in leukocyte traffic and a shift toward proinflammatory type 1-cytokines during the nocturnal period of sleep, that is, an action with strong clinical implications. © 2010 New York Academy of Sciences.},

	abstract = {Numerous studies have shown that post-learning sleep enhances visual episodic recognition memory. However, it remains unclear whether this consolidation benefit is moderated by the emotional valence of the learned material. To clarify whether sleep selectively enhances memory for emotional material, we conducted a meta-analysis including N = 1059 post-sleep/wake observations. Overall, our results do not support this hypothesis. When only studies with a sleep group/wake group comparison were included in the analysis (k = 22), the retention advantage for emotional (negative/positive) over neutral material was not significantly different between sleep and wake groups. When studies without wake groups were included in the analysis after statistical estimation of wake–group parameters, the retention advantage for emotional material was significantly larger in wake groups than in sleep groups (k = 34). Interestingly, however, an additional analysis of eight studies investigating the selective effects of rapid-eye-movement sleep and slow-wave sleep on post-interval emotional memory provided evidence for a selective enhancement of emotional over neutral memory performance after rapid-eye-movement sleep compared to slow-wave sleep. These findings suggest that sleep does not generally enhance visual recognition memory for emotional stimuli. However, the result pattern is consistent with the idea that specific sleep stages preferentially enhance consolidation of emotional and neutral material, respectively.},

When using different physical stimuli across psychological conditions, one faces the problem of disentangling the contributions of low- and high-level factors. Here, we make available the {SHINE} (spectrum, histogram, and intensity normalization and equalization) toolbox for {MATLAB}, which we have found useful for controlling a number of image properties separately or simultaneously. The toolbox features functions for specifying the (rotational average of the) Fourier amplitude spectra, for normalizing and scaling mean luminance and contrast, and for exact histogram specification optimized for perceptual visual quality. {SHINE} can thus be employed for parametrically modifying a number of image properties or for equating them across stimuli to minimize potential low-level confounds in studies on higher level processes.},

In this review, we summarize recent replication failures, null-findings, meta-analyses and studies reporting important boundary conditions for the effect of sleep on declarative memory.
